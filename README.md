# OpenGamesDB

I wasn't able to find something I could easily query to generate configs/etc that I wanted... so I took a ton of data I found & normalied it.

The structure is very simple. Each game has a directory, and then there are several files within that describe aspects of that game.

Although I haven't tried yet, this should be very easy to import into an actual database like MariaDB, SQLite, MySQL, Oracle, etc.
