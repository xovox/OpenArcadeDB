Description from the USA back cover:
Conventional baseball no longer exists in the year 2020. The Super Baseball Association has been very profitable over the years with robotics power players up against the strongest of athletes. Due to the secret manipulation of certain robotics team players, abilities have been computer controlled to decide the outcome of certain games, benefiting the SBA. Die hard players discovered the SBA&apos;s cheating and have now disconnected several parts of the computers to achieve fair and challenging play. Now the games may continue in the famed Cyber-Egg Stadium where only power and skill will determine the winner!
