Sega Genesis 32X (c) 1994 Sega of America, Inc.

The Sega Genesis 32X is an add-on for the Sega Genesis video game console. Codenamed 'Project Mars', the 32X was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a transitional console into the 32-bit era until the later release of the Sega Saturn. Independent of the Genesis, the 32X utilizes its own ROM cartridges and has its own library of games.
