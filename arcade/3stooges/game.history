&quot;Curly, you made us lose again!&quot;
&quot;You Numbskull!&quot;
&quot;Relax, Fellas! Let&apos;s get some more tokens and play Again!&quot;

The Three Stooges: For 1-2-3 Players at the same time.

* The 3 Stooges are searching for their fiancees, kidnapped by the Mad Scientist. Looking at the art gallery, they quickly turn it into a disaster area!
* In all rooms, the Stooges need to destroy the furniture and find the 3 hidden keys that unlock the exit. Using their hammers, Moe, Larry &amp; Curly bang away!
* Interfering socialites and cops are dealt with in typical Stooges style: a face slap, a hammer to the noggin, or the ever-dependable cream pie.
* Bonus round: Avoid the sour notes of the opera singer as you collect the three keys to the exit. And watch out for the cops, too!
* In the Mad Scientist&apos;s laboratory, the Stooges rescue Cora, the first fiancee. That leaves Nora and Dora still in danger! Let the game continue!
