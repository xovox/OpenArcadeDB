7 Ordi (c) 2002 Yun Sung.

7 Ordi is a seven card stud medal game. Once the player meets the minimum number of credits the player is dealt a hand. Three cards are dealt to the player and the computer and one card is chosen to show face up.  Next a card is dealt and a round of betting takes place. Two more cards are dealt face up with a round of betting after each. Then one more card is dealt face down with one more round of betting.

If the player wins then the player may choose to either take his winnings or play a mini-game where he bets on whether the next card will be a low card (1-5), a high card (6-10), or a face card (J,Q,K). After every winning guess the player may choose to continue or drop out.

Hands are dealt until the players credits fall below the minimum level to play.
