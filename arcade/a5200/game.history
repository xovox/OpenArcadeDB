Atari 5200 (c) 1982 Atari, Incorporated.

The Atari 5200 was a video game console introduced as a higher end complementary console for the popular Atari 2600. It was based on Atari's existing 400/800 computers and the internal hardware was almost identical, although software was not directly compatible between the two systems.
