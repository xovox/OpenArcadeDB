Action Fighter (c) 1986 Sega.

An overhead driving / shoot&apos;em up game from Sega which borrows heavily from Bally Midway&apos;s 1983 classic, &quot;Spy Hunter&quot;. The player begins the game riding a motorbike. In subsequent levels a sportscar, a beach buggy, a boat, a chopper and even a Formula-1 racing car can all be driven. All of the vehicles are, of course, fully armed to deal with the many enemy vehicles and gun emplacements intent on stopping the player&apos;s progress. The helicopter levels play as a straightforward vertically-scrolling shoot&apos;em up and bear more than a passing resemblance to Namco&apos;s &quot;Xevious&quot;.
