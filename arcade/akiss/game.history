Mahjong Angel Kiss (c) 1995 Jaleco.

An adult mahjong game, Mahjong Angel Kiss is unique in that it features quite a few animated strip sequences per girl, instead of the standard three or four. Also unique is that the game does not give a set amount of betting funds for each girl, because of this the player cannot progress quicker through the game by depleting the girl&apos;s funds and must play a match for every strip sequence.
