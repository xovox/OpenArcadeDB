Alligator Hunt (c) 1994 Gaelco.

Strange reptilian-looking aliens are invading earth and is up to the most brave and skilled soldiers (apparently a duo of skateboarding youths!) to stop the invasion and destroy the enemy base. Features nice graphics and great shoot&apos;em up gameplay which is quite similar to &quot;Cabal&quot; &amp; &quot;Blood Bros.&quot;.
