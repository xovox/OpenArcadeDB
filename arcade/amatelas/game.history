Sei Senshi Amatelass (c) 1986 Nichibutsu.

Become the Mighty Fighting Amazon and you will search jungles and deserts on the most dangerous island on earth. Your mission is to recapture the men. You desperately need to save the only race of giant womankind from extinction.

You will journey and must conquer 8 forbidden territories of death infested by hungry cannibals and defended by armies of bizarre creatures, each lead by a giant hideous monster whom you must defeat to continue your quest.

Beware, there are many unknown dangers. Remember, you must steal the air mobile cycle and become invincible to succeed against the giant evil that awaits you. Failure would mean the end of the Mighty Amazon forever!
