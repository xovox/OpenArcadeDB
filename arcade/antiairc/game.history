Anti-Aircraft (c) 1975 Atari.

The game improves the skill and the reflexs of the player. The bombers wich are on the screen must be brought down. The bombers arrive either by one or by two, either on the left or on the right of the screen. A bomber which has not been brought down on the first crossing, will come back on the same place, then the player can forestall his shoot. Each player disposes of 3 different positions for firing, wich are used to range. The Cannon, wich has hit the bull&apos;s eye, scores for cach downed bomber.
