APB - All Points Bulletin (c) 1987 Atari Games Corporation.

Players take on the role of policeman &apos;Officer Bob&apos; as he takes to his patrol car and drives the streets in pursuit of lawbreakers. The object of the game is to meet (or preferably exceed) the daily quota of &apos;busts&apos;, as he tries to catch a variety of law-breakers.

Along the way, players must refuel their patrol car (by driving through filling stations) as well as meeting targets within a set time limit. Any accidental collisions or running over of pedestrians will result in the player earning &apos;de-merits&apos;, while a &apos;perfect day&apos; will earn bonuses, with further bonuses awarded for each arrest made that exceeds the daily quota. Picking up donuts extends the time limit for a day.
