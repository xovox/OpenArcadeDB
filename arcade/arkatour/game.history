Tournament Arkanoid (c) 1987 Romstar.

Tournament Arkanoid is an update of the original "Arkanoid" that was released exclusively in the United States. It has an entirely new set of levels, some more difficult than any levels of the original game. Otherwise, gameplay in general is entirely identical to the original.
