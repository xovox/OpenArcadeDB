Armor Attack (c) 1980 Cinematronics.

A wireframe, top-down shoot-em-up in which the player controls a small jeep and must destroy the many tanks and helicopters that populate the war-torn cityscape that represents the game&apos;s single play area. As with many games of the time (&quot;Space Invaders&quot;, &quot;Battlezone&quot;, etc.), Armor Attack&apos;s graphics were simple monochrome, with a colour overlay added to the cabinet to give the impression of multicolour graphics.
