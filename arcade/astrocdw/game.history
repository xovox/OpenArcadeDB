An early video game console made by Bally. It featured 4 built-in programs, the first 2 being arcade game ports from Midway (which was Bally's arcade division). When starting up the console the user could select them by tapping the correct button on the numeric keypad:
1 - Gunfight: arcade port of "Gun Fight [Model 597]"
2 - Checkmate: arcade port of the 1977 'blockade' style game.
3 - Calculator: as the name suggest a tool to do basic calculations
4 - Scribling: This was a doodle/drawing program
