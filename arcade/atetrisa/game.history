Tetris (c) 1989 Atari Games.

Tetris is a legendary tile-matching puzzle game for one or two players in which a random sequence of Tetriminos (geometric shapes composed of four square blocks) fall down the playing field and must be destroyed by positioning them to form complete horizontal lines.

The Tetriminos can be moved left and right and can be rotated 90 degrees. When a complete horizontal line is created, it gets destroyed and any block above the deleted line will fall. Once a certain number of lines have been cleared, the player progresses to the next stage, in which the Tetriminos begin to fall faster, giving players less time to plan and react.

The game's seven tetrominos are:
* I (also a "straight polyomino"): four blocks in a straight line.
* O (also a "square polyomino"): four blocks in a 2Ã—2 square.
* T (also a "T-polyomino"): a row of three blocks with one added below the center.
* J: a row of three blocks with one added below the right side.
* L: a row of three blocks with one added below the left side.
* S: two stacked horizontal dominoes with the top one offset to the right.
* Z: two stacked horizontal dominoes with the top one offset to the left.

All seven Tetriminos are capable of single and double line clears. The I, J, and L pieces are able to clear triples. Only the I Tetrimino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously and this is referred to as a "Tetris".

The game ends when the stack of Tetriminos reaches the top of the playing field and no new Tetriminos are able to enter the play-field.
