BaRaDuKe (c) 1985 Namco, Limited.

BaRaDuKe is a side/vertical scrolling shooter in which the player walks and flies Kissy through an alien base blasting baddies on the way. The scrolling isn&apos;t forced, but players aren&apos;t able to go back once they&apos;ve passed into a new area. Rescuing little rabbit-eared blobby cyclopes will give you a chance at extra hit points. It&apos;s not a brilliant game, but there&apos;s something oddly compelling about it. The little aliens saying &quot;I&apos;m your friend!&quot; when you save them is much appreciated, as is their willingness to sacrifice themselves by suiciding against the boss monster at the end of every level.
