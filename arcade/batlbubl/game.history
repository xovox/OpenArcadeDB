Battle Bubble (c) 1999 Limenko.

Battle Bubble is about 2 lovely mice fighting against rascals who kidnapped their girlfriend. On their way to rescue her, they encounter 'bubbles' in their way. See how they wipe out the bubbles with bubbles.

It features 32 stages, and basic rule requires players to pop off all the bubbles in their way to clear stages. Throw your bubbles into the bothering bubbles of the matching color to pop and remove.

Protect yourself from the troublesome bubbles by blocking them with your bubbles. Collision with the bubbles diminishes player's health. Tricky traps like icy stage and boss stages make enemies even harder to deal with. In couple play mode, the game can be easier or harder depending on the harmony with the partner.
