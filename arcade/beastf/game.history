Beastie Feastie (c) 1984 Epos Corporation.

Guide the insatiable Toby through corridors, up and down the elevators and through the side tunnels in his never-ending search for snacks. An assortment of crafty animals relentlessly pursue Toby and fight him for control of the elevators. Stop them or avoid them and munch a dozen different snacks to clear the 24 unique levels. This game is relatively similar to the glob and Super Glob except the main character's name has been changed to Toby and now looks different.
