Beetle Mania (c) 2000 AGI (Austrian Gaming Industries).

This funky band of beetles will amaze you! Beetle Mania, another multi-line 5 reeler video slot uses animated sequences of bees, snails, moths and worms. When a combination of musical notes appear on the screen, the animation is triggered and this wins you 10 free games.

If a Beetle comes up during a free game, the main character does a live performance for you on stage, and whatever your win metre shows - it will be doubled.
