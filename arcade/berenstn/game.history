The Berenstain Bears in Big Paw&apos;s Cave (c) 1983 Enter-Tech.

The controls are a single 8-way joystick, used to control Brother Bear, a member of the Berenstain Bears family, who is navigating a switchback path across an underground chasm in order to sneak past Big Paw (a non-anthropomorphic bear) and reach the outside. The levels increase in difficulty both by virtue of a longer path and more obstacles, including bats, falling stalactites, etc.
