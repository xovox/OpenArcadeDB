Bio-Ship Paladin (c) 1990 American Sammy Corp.

While the game is essentially a standard horizontally scrolling shoot&apos;em up, it has an innovation that makes it unique in the genre. The player flies a spaceship (specifically, a bioship) which has the standard forward guns to be found in all horizontal scrollers, but it also possesses a weapon that can be manually targeted with a crosshair, in the same manner as in the game &quot;Missile Command&quot;. This allows the player to fire in any direction with pinpoint accuracy, and adds an extra level of strategy to the game. The player&apos;s bioship can also collect power-ups to grow bigger (becoming more powerful), and can acquire spherical pods which attach to the ship and increase its firepower.
