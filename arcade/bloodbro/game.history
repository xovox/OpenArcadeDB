Blood Bros. (c) 1990 TAD.

Blood Bros is an into-the-screen shooter with the action viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective. The brothers can move left and right to avoid incoming fire while the enemies themselves are targeted by moving an on-screen cross-hair over them and pressing fire. If the fire button is held down, the player-character remains static, allowing for more accurate targeting of the cross-hair. While static, the brothers are more vulnerable to incoming enemy fire.

Players have limitless ammunition for their primary gun, and carry a limited number of sticks of dynamite. Dynamite is used in a similar fashion to grenades; it can be thrown at enemies and inflicts greater damage than guns. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed. Each of the game&apos;s stages is littered with structures that can also be destroyed. This removes enemy cover as well as earning players bonus points. 

Power-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed on-screen or dropped by shooting the special characters that occasionally appear, such as the small Indian Chief or warthogs. Points and weaponry can also be dispensed from the tin can, if you shoot it into the air and juggle it with subsequent shots. Some power-ups give special weapons with increased firepower, others grant extra dynamite or points.
