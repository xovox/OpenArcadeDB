beatmania IIDX 5th style (c) 2001 Konami Corp.

DJ simulation game from Konami&apos;s BEMANI series of games. Beatmania IIDX tasks the player with performing songs through a controller consisting of seven key buttons and a scratchable turntable. Hitting the notes with strong timing increases the score and groove gauge bar, allowing the player to finish the stage. Failing to do so depletes the gauge until it is empty, abruptly ending the song.

The game features 35 new songs, five of which are hidden. New features introduced in this version are auto-scratch (allows the player to focus on the 7 keys instead of the turntable), as well as two more Hi-Speed settings (HS2 and HS3.) 5th Style&apos;s songlist featured the first songs that would later become flashing 7s, here differentiated from regular 7s with a kanji meaning Forbidden.
