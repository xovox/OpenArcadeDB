beatmania IIDX 6th style (c) 2001 Konami Corp.

DJ simulation game from Konami's BEMANI series of games. Beatmania IIDX tasks the player with performing songs through a controller consisting of seven key buttons and a scratchable turntable. Hitting the notes with strong timing increases the score and groove gauge bar, allowing the player to finish the stage. Failing to do so depletes the gauge until it is empty, abruptly ending the song.

The game features 40 new songs. 6th Style introduced new features such as letter grades (ranging from F to AAA) and the new Hard Mode (which removes the usual 80% lifebar requirement, but makes the lifebar itself stricter).
