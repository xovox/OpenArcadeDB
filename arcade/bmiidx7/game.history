beatmania IIDX 7th style (c) 2002 Konami Corp.

DJ simulation game from Konami&apos;s BEMANI series of games. Beatmania IIDX tasks the player with performing songs through a controller consisting of seven key buttons and a scratchable turntable. Hitting the notes with strong timing increases the score and groove gauge bar, allowing the player to finish the stage. Failing to do so depletes the gauge until it is empty, abruptly ending the song.

The core gameplay remains the same in 7th Style. 5-key mode has been changed from a difficulty to its own modifier, allowing it to be used on any difficulty level as with normal charts. A new spinoff of Expert Mode also debuted, Daninintei (Class) mode, a mode containing a series of courses ranked so that each course is more difficult than the last, the highest rank course a player can beat in Dan mode is often used to compare players. Dan mode would have significant integration in future styles implementing the e-Amusement system, which could save a player&apos;s rank, and may also restrict access to specific songs based on their current rank.
