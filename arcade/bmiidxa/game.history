beatmania IIDX (c) 1999 Konami Company, Limited.

DJ simulation same from Konami's BEMANI series of games. The objective is to perform songs using a controller with seven keys and a turntable. Hitting notes with accurate timing increases the score and groove gauge bar, allowing the player to finish the stage. Failing to do so depletes the gauge and can prematurely end the song. IIDX has four play modes: 4 Keys, 5 Keys, 7 Keys, and Expert.
