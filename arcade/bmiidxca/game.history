&quot;Dance Dance Revolution 2ndMix with beatmania IIDX substream club version 2&quot; is able to link with &quot;beatmania IIDX substream&quot;. Both machines contain 42 songs, including the 13 from DDR club version. &quot;club version 2&quot; allows the DDR player(s) to change the step pattern difficulty before each song, between Basic, Another, and Maniac (or just Basic and Another for Doubles mode). Song selection can be done on either machine, but the game now ends if any one of the players fails the song.

&quot;club version 2&quot; also introduces the Catastrophic level of difficulty for 9-foot songs.
