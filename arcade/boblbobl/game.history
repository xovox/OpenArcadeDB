Bobble Bobble (c) 1986.

This game is a pirate version of &quot;Bubble bobble&quot;. Unlike the original game: 
* The left player (&apos;Bub&apos;) can have only a total of two extends. 
* This bootleg has a new feature in Dip switch where you may control the speed of monsters. 
* The monsters &apos;Mighta&apos;, &apos;Hidegonsu&apos;, and &apos;Drunk&apos; do not throw their projectile weapons (i.e. &apos;Mighta&apos; does not throw his slow-moving stone balls, &apos;Hidegonsu&apos; does not throw his fast-moving fireballs, and &apos;Drunk&apos; does not throw his boomerang bottles). However, the &apos;Invader&apos; monster, who appears in &apos;Normal&apos; mode only, does throw his laser projectile.
