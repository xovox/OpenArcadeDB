4 Player Bowling Alley (c) 1978 Midway.

An old black and white bowling game for up to 4 players.  The players must use the trackball to guide a bowling ball towards the ten pins in order to knock them down. At the start of the game the players must choose between &apos;regulation&apos; and &apos;flash&apos; modes.

The text &apos;NOW BOWLING&apos; will appear above the number of the player who is currently taking his turn (instead of only &apos;BOWLER&apos;), and there is also a single button to switch between straight and hook shots - however, if your ball goes off the top of the screen, the text of &apos;FOUL SHOOT AGAIN&apos; will appear and you will have to take your turn again. The fifth and tenth frames are also referred to as &apos;beer frames&apos; by the game, and just like in real bowling, whoever has the highest score at the end of the game will get declared the winner; the perfect score (for &apos;regulation&apos; mode) is 300, while in the time-based &apos;flash&apos; score mode, the perfect score is 7500.
