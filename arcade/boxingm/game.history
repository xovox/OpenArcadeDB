Boxing Mania - Ashita no Joe (c) 2001 Konami Corp.

Based on the 1970&apos;s anime Ashita no Joe, players take on the role of Joe Yabuki in the ring against his toughest rivals. Players jab, swing, and punch at the four targets that swing out from the left and right side of the cabinet in order to land blows against their opponent.  Taking cues from the onscreen action players dodge attacks by ducking away from the cabinet.  When knocked to the mat players must hit the bar near the bottom of the screen repeatedly to get back up.  And when the opportunity arises, players are prompted to deliver an uppercut to the flashing face-shaped target at the top of the cabinet, often delivering a knock-out punch to finish the match.
