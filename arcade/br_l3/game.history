The basic idea of this pinball is to sink ships. The game features a rotating cannon situated underneath the playfield used to aim the ball at targets to award letters in the word SINK SHIP. During multiball you also get letters for shooting flashing ramps. Once SINK SHIP is spelled, you load the cannon to light the center shot (the &apos;Broadside&apos;) to get big points.
