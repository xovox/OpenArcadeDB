Block People (c) 2009 Sega Enterprises, Limited.

The players have to stack up physical blocks against a screen in order to guide little orange &apos;Block People&apos; characters around a stage. The main part of the game is set up as a series of small challenges, requiring that you make the Block People gather fruit or touch numbered icons in a certain order, all under constraint of time.
