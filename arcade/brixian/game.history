BriXian (c) 1993 Cheil Computer System.

BriXian is a block game that is a very similar to Towers of Hanoi except instead of big objects and not being able to touch the bigger objects and making them go in order of size, you have to move certain shapes to touch in the right order or the game will say "Can't Complete!" If you choose "WAKE UP!" you can make your own levels.
