Bubble Trouble - Golly! Ghost! 2 (c) 1992 Namco, Limited.

Use your gun to shoot fish, crabs and other sea creatures at the bottom of the ocean. This is a sequel to &quot;Golly! Ghost!&quot; that is themed around sunken treasure. It cleverly projects several scenes of video animation onto a real 3-D diorama backdrop.
