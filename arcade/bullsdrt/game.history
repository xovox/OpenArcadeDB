Bulls Eye Darts (c) 1985 Magic Electronics.

Three basic dart games in one: &apos;High Score&apos;, &apos;301&apos;, and &apos;Round the Clock&apos;. The player rolls the trackball to move the player&apos;s arm, rolls forward and then presses the fire button to release the dart. Players take turns as in a standard dart game. Winning a free game by getting a good score is possible.
