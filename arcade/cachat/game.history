Cachat (c) 1993 Taito Corp.

Cachat is a very challenging puzzle game where you must complete a line from one electrode along the sides to another, same side or other side. Blocks fall from the top of the screen, but if they reach the top of the playing area, the game is over. This mind-blowing fast game is very highly addictive. The gameplay is quite easy but requires a lot of attention.
