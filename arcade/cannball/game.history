Cannon Ball [Horizontal Screen version] (c) 1995 Yun Sung.

This game is like a crossover between &quot;Arkanoid&quot; and &quot;Puzzle Bobble&quot;. You have a paddle and must shoot the ball trying to match with the same color balls on the descending balls. If you connect three or more balls in the same color they will disappear. After the balls disappear, any balls that become detached from the descending structure also disappear. Balls can be shot in three directions: 45 degrees to the left, 45 degrees to the right, or strait up. If you are in difficult situation, you can shoot a bomb. 

Once you clear a set number of disappearances, the stage is cleared and the player is rewarded with a digitized photo image of an Asian girl in her underwear. Each stage features a different picture with a different girl.

If the descending balls reach the players paddle, then the game is over. If you continue you restart at previous stage.
