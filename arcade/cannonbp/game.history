Cannon Ball (c) 1985 Novomatic.

Cannon Ball is a game similar to Breakout except with a twist. Instead of having to clear all of the bricks, you have to destroy a &quot;bat&quot; being protected by all of the bricks. The &quot;bat&quot; tries to kill you by throwing monsters at you which, if hit by one, your paddle shrinks. Once your paddle is invisible, you get a game over. You can also eat the monsters by ramming into one once they are on your playing field.
