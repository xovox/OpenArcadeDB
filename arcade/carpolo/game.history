Car Polo (c) 1977 Exidy.

Car Polo is an 'up-to-four player' full color video game that combines the skills of driving with the intense player interaction of team sports. The object is to score by bumping or pushing the ball with a car into your team's goal. Teamwork revolves around passing and blocking strategy. Play becomes fast and furious, and excitement is enhanced by car motor noises, crash sounds, controlled grass skids and bouncing ball motions.
