Casanova (c) 1994 Promat Company, Limited.

Casanova is a Mahjong-like game made by Promat with girls. You play as a boy who wants to attract girls (hence the name casanova) and the coinup screen is actually the reason this games&apos; plot exists. The boy is bored, so he decides to watch some TV.  Finding nothing good until he finds a channel with girls dancing to the beat of a song that goes &quot;Come on WHOO!&quot; (Which might be an actual song). Then the boy thinks &quot;I gotta get girls like these!&quot; and gets up to find women lke the dancers. He then finds this palace of buildings named such as &quot;The Girl&apos;s&quot; and &quot;WELCOM LADIES&quot;, and the spelling/grammar is slightly off as that&apos;s how it appears in-game. To get to the girls, the boy must solve puzzles in order to see their glory. 
In true fashion, this game is pretty much Mahjong with a couple tweaks and of course, girls. There is a &quot;special move&quot; that makes a dancing super-hero  figure show up for a little bit, then a missile drops down on the mahjong board, removing random tiles from the board. While this all happens, one of the songs from a 1970&apos;s Beach music EP plays (which I can&apos;t remember the name of and I&apos;m too lazy to shazam). Once you complete a level, you get to see part of a girls&apos; body.
