Chase Bombers (c) 1994 Taito.

A chase-view crazy racing game.

WELCOME TO THE CUSTOMIZED CAR CARNIVAL!

Choose your Vehicle and one of the challenging race courses. Rev your engine and get ready to roll. Be careful - there are mines and steel poles as obstacles to slow you down. Rival racers attack and obstruct you with items. You must avoid their traps and use your own items to your advantage. Pick them up on the Item Gates spread across the course. Use your specialized arsenal to crash the enemy drivers and race for the checkered flag!

There are five customized vehicles to choose from, including a Formula-One machine and a custom truck.
