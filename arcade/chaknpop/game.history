Chack&apos;n Pop (c) 1984 Taito.

Chack&apos;n Pop is considered by many to be the precursor to the venerable game Bubble Bobble. The cast consists of two enemies that would later be seen in Bubble Bobble. Many fans of the Bubble Bobble series may find Chack&apos;n Pop less fun to play due to its high degree of difficulty.

The game puts the player in the role of Mr. Chack&apos;n, who must rescue all of the hearts that were stolen during a romantic interlude between him and Miss Chack&apos;n. Chack&apos;n is an interesting character with equally interesting abilities. He can toss two bombs, only one in each direction at a time. He can also effortlessly go from walking on the floor to walking on the ceiling. If the ceiling is low enough, Chack&apos;n can extend his legs until his head touches the ceiling to immediately begin walking on it.

Chack&apos;n must use his bombs to release the captured hearts from their cages. Once all of the hearts are freed, he can escape through the top right corner of the maze. Along the way, purple Monstas will be trying to stop Chack&apos;n simply by colliding with him. Chack&apos;n can use his bombs to defeat the Monstas, but the limited use he has over them makes the bombs an unreliable attack method. Once Chack&apos;n spends enough time in a maze, it is not uncommon for him to become completely overwhelmed by the presence of the Monstas.
