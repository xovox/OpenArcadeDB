Chequered Flag (c) 1988 Konami.

Chequered Flag is an overhead-view racing game featuring rotational sprite scaling. The player races over a series of twisting courses, trying to reach the finish line before the timer expires.

The game includes a Pit-stop facility, a feature that had appeared a year earlier in Taito&apos;s &quot;Continental Circus&quot;. Should the player&apos;s car sustain too much damage, a pit-stop must be made to implement repairs. A &apos;damage meter&apos; at the bottom of the screen shows the severity of the damage; highlighting what car components are in need of repair; Engine, Front Tires, Rear Tires and Brakes.
