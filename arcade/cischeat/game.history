Cisco Heat [Simulator model] (c) 1990 Jaleco.

A colourful racing game in which the player takes on the role of a police officer who must race his squad car (from a choice of 2; offering either improved &apos;Speed&apos; or &apos;Cornering&apos; respectively) through the undulating, winding streets of San Francisco&apos;, in an attempt to win the first ever &apos;National Championship Police Car Steeplechase&apos;.

Each stage is packed with rival squad cars, as well as civilian traffic such as taxis, trams and fire-engines. Ninety-degree turns must also be negotiated in this tricky driving game. Cisco Heat features five different stages.
