Columns II: The Voyage Through Time was the sequel to Columns. It featured the normal puzzle game play, but was only released in Japan in the arcades. It is not clear as to why it was subtitled &quot;The Voyage Through Time&quot;, other than the minor tile differences which seem to  attempt to indicate future and past ages: they are labeled as Machine Theme, Pale Green Theme, and Classic Theme.
