He may keep his win with the &apos;Take&apos; button or try to double it with the &apos;Double&apos; button. If &apos;Double&apos; is selected, a random display of Male and Female Pixels flash on the screen. The player then presses either the &apos;Male&apos; or &apos;Female&apos; button. When the action stops, if the Pixel on the screen matches the button presses, he wins.
