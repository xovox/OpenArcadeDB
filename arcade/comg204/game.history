Super Blackjack (c) 1984 Cal Omega.

As the name implies, this is not an ordinary Blackjack game. It is super in every respect. Up to 6 cards may be displayed on each hand and a new deck is used for each game. After the player&apos;s first 2 cards are dealt he has the option of doubling his score. Additional cards are received each time the &apos;Hit&apos; button is pressed. The player then stands by using the &apos;Stand&apos; button and the dealer then receives additional cards until the game ends. In addition to standard play, the player can split any natural pair or 2 &apos;ten&apos; valued cards and play 2 hands against the dealer. Insurance against the dealer is available if the dealer shows an &apos;Ace&apos; or &apos;Ten&apos; valued card. The win table includes some exciting 3-card combination wins.
