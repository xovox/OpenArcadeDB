Super Blackjack (c) 1984 Cal Omega.

As the name implies, this is not an ordinary Blackjack game. It is super in every respect. Up to 6 cards may be displayed on each hand and a new deck is used for each game. After the player's first 2 cards are dealt he has the option of doubling his score. Additional cards are received each time the 'Hit' button is pressed. The player then stands by using the 'Stand' button and the dealer then receives additional cards until the game ends. In addition to standard play, the player can split any natural pair or 2 'ten' valued cards and play 2 hands against the dealer. Insurance against the dealer is available if the dealer shows an 'Ace' or 'Ten' valued card. The win table includes some exciting 3-card combination wins.
