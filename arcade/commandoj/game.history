戦場の狼 (c) 1985 Capcom.
(Senjou no Ookami)

Senjou no Ookami is a vertically-scrolling shoot&apos;em up in which the player takes on the role of a highly trained commando soldier. The mission is to rescue captives and destroy enemy bases and strongholds, killing as many enemy soldiers as possible in the process. The commando carries only 2 weapons : a limited-range machine gun with unlimited shots, and a limited supply of hand grenades. Extra grenades can be picked up as the player progresses through the levels.
