Crash&apos;n Score (c) 1975 Atari.

A videogame in which either one or two players drive race cars on a rectangular playfield and earn score points by driving through lighted score flags. During play a player has to maneuver his/her car around certain obstacles and has to avoid the opponent&apos;s car.

In Crash&apos;n Score a player&apos;s objective is to build up his/her point score. He/she does this by driving his/her race car through as many lighted flags as as he/she can before the game time runs out. A player controls car direction with the steering wheel and car speed with the gas pedal. In a 1-player game only one race car appears.

On the screen the following playfield obstacles appear: oil slicks, unlighted flags, a player-selectable set of barriers, and (in a 2-player game only) collisions with the opponent car.

Each flag is labeled with a numeral ranging from 1 to 7, and at any one moment no more than a single flag can be lighted. When a player succeeds in driving through a lighted flag, a number of points equal to that flag&apos;s numeral is added to the player&apos;s accumulated score. The scores are continuously displayed near the top of the screen. After a car has driven through a lighted flag, that flag will cease to be lighted and some other flag, randomly chosen, will light up. During the final one-eighth of game time the number of points added to a player&apos;s score will be double the numeral shown in the lighted flag.
