Crime Fighters (c) 1989 Konami.

Plenty of young &amp; beautiful women are missing and the city&apos;s local kingpin is the main suspect. As a group of street vigilantes you must venture into the most dangerous zones of your city and destroy all street punks &amp; criminals that are dumb enough to get in your way in order to rescue the girls! Features colorful graphics, a catchy soundtrack, some cool moves (such as striking downed enemies) and a good challenge. Like the idea of fighting to rescue a beautiful damsel in distress? Why not a huge bunch of &apos;em so its worth your time!
