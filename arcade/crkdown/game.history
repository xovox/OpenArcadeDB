Crack Down (c) 1989 Sega.

A futuristic city has been over-taken by a powerful, bio-mechanical army; created by an evil scientist in a bid to take over the world. 2 elite agents must plant a series of time bombs to destroy their base and crush the rebellion.

The 1- or 2-player shoot-em-up action is displayed via an innovative split screen that allows 2 players to work either individually or as a team. A timer countdown timers adds to the tension. Time bombs must be set by running over areas marked with an &apos;X&apos;; while machine guns and cannons can be reloaded by finding the ammo caches that appear on each level. If ammo runs out, players must result to punching and kicking to defeat opponents.
