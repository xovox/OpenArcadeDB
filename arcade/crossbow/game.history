Crossbow (c) 1983 Exidy.

Early first-person shoot&apos;em up game with a dungeons and dragons feel about it. Features good speech and screams.

Gameplay requires the player to protect a band of adventurers (referred to as &quot;friends&quot; by the game) from afar by shooting objects that threaten them. The adventurers enter from the left-hand side of the screen and attempt to cross the screen unharmed. If the player helps them reach the opposite side of the screen safely, the adventurers survive to the next scenario, and new adventurers are occasionally granted between scenarios. In addition to the obstacles, the adventurers are vulnerable to the player&apos;s shots. The first time the player shoots an adventurer, an on-screen message is shown: &quot;DON&apos;T SHOOT YOUR FRIENDS!&quot; Thereafter, shooting an adventurer will cause him/her to emit a cry of pain, and to walk at a slower pace the rest of the way. A second shot will kill the adventurer.Scenarios are chosen by shooting a destination on a map screen, which include: town, desert, volcano, cave, bridge, jungle, and castle.

The short path to reach the castle is by using the following Color paths -&gt;  Green -&gt; Blue -&gt; Blue -&gt; Red.

The goal is to reach the final scenario, past the castle, in which the player confronts the Masterâ€”who presumably created the dangers in the game. Defeating the Master of Darkness requires shooting him in the eyes when they turn red (and deadly). The player is treated to a brief congratulation and a challenge to defeat the Master again, but if you dare. Following this screen the player starts over with however many adventurers survived the confrontation.
