Crossed Swords (c) 1991 Alpha Denshi.

A rather unique 3rd-person fantasy action game, as a traveling knight you must help those in need of a hero by slashing the evil monsters & demons that disrupt peace. It will be a tough battle but your skill with your sword, some spells and some special weapons that you can purchase along the way will see you through this nightmare. Godspeed brave knight!
