Capcom Sports Club (c) 1997 Capcom Company, Limited.

Capcom Sports Club is a multi-event sports game for one or two players who can choose to play any one of three different sports games: Tennis (Smash Stars), Football (Kick Stars) and Basketball (Dunk Stars).

The game's look and feel is typical of Capcom's output of the time and is skewed heavily towards fast, cartoon-like arcade action.

Of the three games on offer, "Smash Stars" Tennis is by far the most accomplished and would easily stand up as an arcade machine in its own right.
