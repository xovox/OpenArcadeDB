Capcom Sports Club (c) 1997 Capcom Company, Limited.

Capcom Sports Club is a multi-event sports game for one or two players who can choose to play any one of three different sports games: Tennis (Smash Stars), Football (Kick Stars) and Basketball (Dunk Stars).

The game&apos;s look and feel is typical of Capcom&apos;s output of the time and is skewed heavily towards fast, cartoon-like arcade action.

Of the three games on offer, &quot;Smash Stars&quot; Tennis is by far the most accomplished and would easily stand up as an arcade machine in its own right.
