Cube Quest (c) 1983 Simutrek.

In Cube Quest, you must maneuver your space ship through a series of corridors in the Cube. You start off with a radar display of the cube, deciding which of the 54 corridors you want to start in. Each corridor has several enemy fighters that are determined to defeat you. Once you defeat the enemies you zoom back to the radar display of the Cubic World to chose another corridor to travel in. Once you complete all the corridors, you are rewarded with the Treasure of Mytha, Master of the Cube Quest.
