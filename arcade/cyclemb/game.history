Cycle Mahbou (c) 1984 Taito Corp.

It's a rather unique game of skill and different test. You play the role of a guy on a unicycle he advance through the track, and must performed timed jumps to land on various items to collect points, holding the button longer does longer jumps or short jumps. At the same time you need to balance your character using the paddle / spinner control so things can get quite tricky. Each stage gives you a target score and a bonnus stage.
