Dancing Eyes (c) 1996 Namco.

A typically Japanese flavoured puzzle game in which the idea is to &apos;colour in&apos; areas of women&apos;s clothing in order to strip them to their underwear. Gameplay is a variation on Konami&apos;s popular and much-copied 1981 classic, &quot;Amidar&quot;. Once a level is completed, the player can watch their on-screen female counterpart &apos;dance&apos;, during which the player can use the joystick to move the in-game camera.
