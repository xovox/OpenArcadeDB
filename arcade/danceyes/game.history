Dancing Eyes (c) 1996 Namco.

A typically Japanese flavoured puzzle game in which the idea is to 'colour in' areas of women's clothing in order to strip them to their underwear. Gameplay is a variation on Konami's popular and much-copied 1981 classic, "Amidar". Once a level is completed, the player can watch their on-screen female counterpart 'dance', during which the player can use the joystick to move the in-game camera.
