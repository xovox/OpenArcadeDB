Darius Gaiden - Silver Hawk - Extra Version (c) 1995 Taito Corp.

An official hack with increased rapid fire and swapped bosses.

In a 1-player game, if you press 2P Start, you won&apos;t be able to select your path at the end of a level, and you&apos;ll have to complete the 28 levels to end the game. The same trick is available in a 2-player game if you press 2P Start first, then let Player 1 join in.
