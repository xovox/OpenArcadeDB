Dark Seal (c) 1990 Data East Corporation.

Fantasy hack and slash game in which up to four people can play at the same time, choosing from three stock fantasy characters (Knight, Wizard and Bard) and, for some reason, a Ninja. Players must then fight their way through enemy-packed levels, plundering treasure and avoiding the game&apos;s many traps. Gameplay is highly reminiscent of Atari&apos;s legendary 1985 classic, &quot;Gauntlet&quot;.
