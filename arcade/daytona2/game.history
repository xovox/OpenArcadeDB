Daytona USA 2 - Battle On The Edge (c) 1998 Sega.

The wild and hot run is back. 16 people can run together. Not only the body of the machine and the road surface, but also smoke and the flames for the crash scenes are reproduced beautifully. The game also uses the real engines&apos; sounds from the real cars.
