D.D. Crew (c) 1991 Sega.

D.D. Crew is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for up to four players, taking on the roles of &apos;Buster&apos;, &apos;King&apos;, &apos;F.F.&apos; and &apos;Gung Ho&apos;. Enemies attack from all directions, including from out of doorways and other background features. All on-screen enemies must be defeated before players can progress. 

Players can pick up weapons along the way, including knives and grenades, as well as other items, including extra lives and health points. Players also can pick up and throw enemies either to the ground or at other enemies. 

One unique feature of D.D. Crew is a counter that informs players of how many enemies they have defeated. Players also have the ability to perform dash attacks by pressing the joystick left or right twice, while pressing the attack button.
