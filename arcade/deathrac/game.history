Death Race (c) 1976 Exidy, Incorporated.

Drive a car around the field chasing down as many zombies as possible and run them over, turning them into instant tombstones, before the timer expires. Play with a friend to see who can make more tombstones quicker. After you run someone over, the game designers were nice enough to include a reverse gear to finish the victim off.
