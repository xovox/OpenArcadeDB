Derby Owners Club (c) 1999 Sega.

This is a thoroughbred horse racing video game that allows players to own, breed, train, and ride their very own race horse. A data-storing card is dispensed with the first play, allowing each player to continuously develop their horse, offspring, and stables through repeat play. The innovative cabinet design allows up to 4 players to race simultaneously.
