Dig Dug II (c) 1985 Namco.

For this sequel to the 1982 classic, &quot;Dig Dug&quot;, Namco changed the game&apos;s perspective from a cutaway side-on viewpoint to an overhead one. The action now takes place on a series of small islands, the gameplay itself retains much from its predecessor, with Dig Dug still being chased by the &apos;Pookas&apos; (round, goggle-wearing red enemies) and the &apos;Fygers&apos; (green, fire-breathing dragons).

As with the first game, Dig Dug is still armed with a pump that allows him to inflate and burst the enemies. For the sequel, however, he is also armed with a jackhammer. This can be used at the round ground-pegs scattered around each island to create and connect up fault lines in the ground. If both ends of a system of faults reaches the water, the ground surrounded by them will sink into the ocean killing all creatures on it, including Dig Dug himself if he is standing on the destroyed section of land.

The Pookas and Fygers cannot cross any fault lines while in solid monster form but as with the first game, they can take on a ghost form and move wherever they wish.

Once three pieces of land have been cut off an island, a bonus vegetable will appear somewhere on the remaining land, this can be eaten for extra points. When only one, two or (on later rounds) three enemies remain on the island, they will eventually head for the edge of the island and jump into the water, killing themselves and costing the player points.
