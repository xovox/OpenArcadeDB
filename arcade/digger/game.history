Digger (c) 1980 Gremlin Ind.

Digger is a game that requires you to dig strategically placed holes within a maze format so you can capture and fill in over the invading creatures before they can attack and destroy your man. The maze format changes with every round played.

The creatures are confined behind a wall. In the first of three rounds of game play, four creatures are let out of the holding area through a gate. You must conquer these four before advancing to the next round, where you face six creatures. Your third round has you battling eight creatures. This process is repeated and the point value increased with each three-round victory. Also, creatures&apos; speed increases each round. Any contact at all with the creatures will be fatal to your man.

While you are busy digging holes and entrapping creatures, the rest are behind the retaining wall scurrying back and forth. After about three minutes, the gates at each end will open and all of the remaining creatures will stream into the play area at once. However, a skillful player will conquer all of the creatures of each round and the gate will not be a threat.
