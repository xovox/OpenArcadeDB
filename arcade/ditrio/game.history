Become a part of the ultimate mission with DIAMOND TRIO, a 9-line 5-reel video slot. Be captivated by the three daring LADIES as they lead you through this lucrative feature, where each LADY can double your fortune.

LADY substitutes for all symbols. 3 scattered LADY trigger 12 free games. If only 2 LADY appear on the screen, the reel with the missing LADY is respun and all other reels are held, for a second chance to trigger the feature. Each LADY appearing during the feature doubles the win of that game. Free games can be re-triggered.
