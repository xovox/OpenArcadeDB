Donkey Kong 3 (c) 1983 Nintendo.

The third and final arcade outing for Donkey Kong sees the giant ape once again cast as the enemy. Unlike the first two Donkey Kong games, the legendary character Mario is not featured in this game. Instead, the player takes on the role of Stanley the Bugman, a gardener who is armed with a bug spray with which he must destroy the swarms of insects that attack him and try to steal his plants. 

Each level has five plants that must be protected. Stanley must also spray Kong to force the ape to the top of the screen and complete the level.
