Dogosoken (c) 1986 SNK.

Dogosoken is the sequel to Ikari. It was developed by SNK, and released in the arcades in 1986, later in the same year that the original game appeared. Like the original, Dogosoken featured an 8-way rotary joystick that could be twisted in place to rotate the onscreen character allowing the player to face in one of eight directions while moving in another. The rotary joystick serves two simultaneous purposes. The joystick can be pushed in any one of eight direction to direct the players to move in that direction. As either player advances to the top of the screen, the screen will automatically scroll down. If the player retreats, the screen will scroll up, but only to a limited extent. The second purpose of the joystick is to control the orientation of the players. The joystick can be rotated clockwise or counter-clockwise. As the joystick is rotated, so too will the players rotate in the same direction. In this manner, a player can move in any direction while continuing to face one particular direction.

The objective is to defeat the enemy aliens using grenades and other weapons. The story directly picks up at the ending of Ikari Warriors. Congratuled by General Kawasaki for rescuing him, Paul and Vince return home to their native country in a plane arranged by the general. Expecting a hero&apos;s welcome upon arriving home, a mysterious storm appears and they are hurtled thousands of years into the future. They are met by an alien creature who says that the villain Zang Zip has taken over the land.

The arcade features sampled voiceovers from the main characters and the game&apos;s bosses.
