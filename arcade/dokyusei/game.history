Mahjong Doukyuusei is a strip mahjong game featuring four girls with three strip sequences each.

Each opponent is played in order, After each winning hand the player is shown a highly animated strip sequence of his opponent. After winning three hands the player advances to the next opponent.

Oddly, for the final opponent, only the last strip sequence features her, with the first two featuring two different girls from the original PC game.
