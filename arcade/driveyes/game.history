Driver&apos;s Eyes (c) 1991 Namco.

Driver&apos;s Eyes was a state of the art Formula One Simulator, a follow up to &quot;Winning Run&quot; (1988). one of its most advanced features for 1991 was the 3-D solid polygons and the major sound clean up (music composed by Hiroyuki Kawada, who also composed music for Air Combat, Winning Run etc.). The player would select his/her level of racing, Novice or Grand Prix, then transmission select (Easy Drive or Technical Drive). When the selections were made, the game would then show a short animation of the engine going into the engine bay and the body work gliding down (changing view to the cockpit) revealing a sign saying BRAKES ON. Once the sign lifts the race starts (in novice mode Grand Prix was on the starting grid). Also the game featured a panoramic view thanks to a 3 monitor setup (controlled by 3 system 21&apos;s!). The game also had an LCD display in the player&apos;s cockpit in sync with the speed on the screen.
