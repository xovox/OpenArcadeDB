Dynamite Bomber (c) 2000 Limenko.

The &apos;Dynamite Bomber&apos; is about our three heroes Mic, Mae and Dan, exploring the world, giving a hard time to native gangsters maneuvering the world of disorder. They shall encounter gangsters in Hong Kong, Nazis in Germany, etc.

How to Play? Face them with the &apos;Bombs&apos;. Player can throw their bombs directly to enemies or their structures. Or you can lay lots of bombs at strategic point and fire them away altogether for a maximum impact. And you can scheme a pattern bombing for which player array bombs in a row along the enemy&apos;s path and structures. Fire one of them and all the bombs explode one by one.

Each character has it&apos;s own specialty : Mic can command a Charge Shot, and Mae can order an untouchable Flash Move, while Dan fly free.
