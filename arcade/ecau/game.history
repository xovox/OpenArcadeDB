Emergency Call Ambulance (c) 1999 Sega.

Become an emergency medical technician in Emergency Call Ambulance. Day or night, you&apos;re on the call! Race to the scene of a serious traffic accident, spectacular fire or senseless act of big city violence. You&apos;re mission : get the injured to the hospital emergency room as quickly and safely as possible! Players are kept aware of their patient&apos;s condition by monitoring their &apos;health point&apos; indicator. Reckless driving or hitting other vehicles will dramatically reduce your patient&apos;s &apos;health point&apos; indicator. Follow the on-screen directions or choose your own route. The game ends if the &apos;health point&apos; indicator reaches zero before you deliver the patient to the hospital. Make it in time, and you&apos;re off to the next emergency call!
