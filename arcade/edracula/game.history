Dracula (c) 1981 Epoch Co., Ltd.

You are a treasure hunter seeking the treasure hidden in a coffin in Dracula's castle. But watch out — dangers lie ahead! You must escape the Wolfman, break down a wall to enter the Underground Labyrinth and evade a Vampire Bat as you try to collect all the diamonds. In Dracula's Castle, there are four coffins. Chose carefully — only one coffin contains the treasure. If you open the wrong one, you'll find Dracula inside instead of the treasure.
