Eggor (c) 1983 Telko.

Eggor is a multi-directional shooter/maze arcade game. It runs on Namco&apos;s Pac-Man hardware and appears to be based on Digitrex Techstar&apos;s Eyes, which was released the previous year. The player must use a 4-way joystick to take up control of a baby vulture, Eggor through eight different mazes and use a single button to shoot all the eggs while getting pursued by five adult vultures. If Eggor shoots one of them, they will disappear for a few moments before rehatching. If one of the adult vultures shoots Eggor he will lose a life. Shooting an egg is worth 500 points on the first round and increases by 250 for every subsequent round, while shooting an adult vulture is worth 100 points upon the first round and increases by 100 for every subsequent round.
