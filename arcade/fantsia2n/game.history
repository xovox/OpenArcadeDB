Fantasia II (c) 1997 Comad.

An adult variation - one of several released by the company - of the 1981 Taito classic, "Qix" (and, latterly, "Gal Panic" from Kaneko), in which players must 'colour in' sections of the background in order to reveal a digitised picture of a naked woman in an erotic pose. Like "Qix" and its sequels, Fantasia's levels are populated with a number of enemies who must be avoided or destroyed. As well as the enemies, players are also fighting against a tight time limit.
