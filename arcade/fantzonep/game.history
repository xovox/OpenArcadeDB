Fantasy Zone (c) 1986 Sega Enterprises, Limited.

The Fantasy Zone is under attack by an army of ruthless, yet undeniably cute, alien enemies. A fearless space fighter by the name of &apos;Opa-opa&apos; (a craft that is as cute as the game&apos;s enemies, featuring wings and feet - the latter appearing whenever the player flies down to ground level at the bottom of the screen) must stop the alien invasion to restore peace to the Fantasy Zone, as well as finding his missing father, &apos;Opapa&apos;, in the process.

Each level has a number of large, enemy generating ships, that produce a constant stream of enemies to attack the player. While the enemies the generators produce can either be shot or avoided, the generators themselves MUST be destroyed. Once the generators are gone, an end-of-level ship will appear that must be beaten to complete the level.

Fantasy Zone is rendered with the surreal, brightly coloured graphics that typify many Japanese videogames; with an equally abstract approach to in-game weapons: with that cartoon comedy staple, the &apos;anvil&apos;, making an appearance.
