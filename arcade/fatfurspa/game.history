Just as the name implies, this is a special edition of &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; filled with plenty of fun stuff. Features a few old familiar faces from the first game as newcomers; background with 2 battle planes; improved control and lots of secrets. Without a doubt, one of the better chapters in the series!
