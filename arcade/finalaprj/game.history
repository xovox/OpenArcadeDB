Final Lap R (c) 1994 Namco.

The last game in Namco&apos;s seminal F1 series, which began twelve years&apos; earlier with 1982&apos;s &quot;Pole Position&quot;. Final Lap R features the same loose handling and demanding game-play of its predecessors, but has the obligatory improved graphics, due to the more powerful host hardware. The game offers players a choice of four race tracks :
1. Germany
2. Brazil
3. Hungary
4. Belgium
