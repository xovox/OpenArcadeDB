Final Lap R (c) 1994 Namco.

The last game in Namco's seminal F1 series, which began twelve years' earlier with 1982's "Pole Position". Final Lap R features the same loose handling and demanding game-play of its predecessors, but has the obligatory improved graphics, due to the more powerful host hardware. The game offers players a choice of four race tracks :
1. Germany
2. Brazil
3. Hungary
4. Belgium
