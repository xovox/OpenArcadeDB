Final Lap (c) 1987 Namco, Limited.

A Formula One racing game featuring several courses. The gameplay is similar in feel to Namco&apos;s 1982 legend, &quot;Pole Position&quot;, although the steering is much looser than that of its legendary predecessor. Down shifting and brakes play major parts in keeping control of the car on the tight, winding courses. Bumping another car will not cause the player&apos;s car to explode - as in &quot;Pole position&quot; - but can send the player OR the rival driver spinning off the track, costing valuable seconds.
