Finest Hour (c) 1989 Namco.

Stomp through the enemy opposition in your very own assault mech! Equipped with a laser beam, Vernier jump-jets, auto-targeting, and automatic cooling system, this mech is a force to be reckoned with. Of course, the enemy doesn&apos;t know that yet, do they? Teach &apos;em a lesson in threat assessment!
