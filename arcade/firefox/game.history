FireFox (c) 1984 Atari.

You pilot the fastest, most sophisticated plane on the face of the earth that has just been stolen from Russia. You fly through different areas shooting enemy MIGS and other FireFox prototypes. You must avoid Russian infra-red radar tracking and find the refueling points to make it further into the game. High altitude flying would use less fuel but would make FireFox more vulnerable to detection. Flying at a low altitude would use more fuel but would give you better cover from the MIGS.
