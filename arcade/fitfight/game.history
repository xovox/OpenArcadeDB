Fit of Fighting (c) 199? NIX.

A reconstructed sprite-ripped bootleg of Art of Fighting with all eight characters selectable in any mode. It has:
* FM music.
* No damage in the fighters faces.
* No zooms.
* Poor AI.
* Poor gameplay (you have to execute the special attacks very slowly to get them running!).
* Ripped graphics but reprogrammed from scratch.
