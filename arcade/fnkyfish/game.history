Funky Fish (c) 1981 Sun Electronics.

Our &apos;fishy&apos; protagonist must attack groups of small fish that are defending a monster. Shoot bubbles at the fish until they change to fruit. If you don&apos;t eat the fruit it will fall to the seabed and awaken a sleeping seashell that releases a sea horse to attack you.
