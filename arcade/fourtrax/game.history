Four Trax (c) 1989 Namco, Limited.

The player must take control for four quad bikes (red for Player 1, white for Player 2, yellow for Player 3, and green for Player 4), which are competing in an &quot;off-road&quot; race - and they all have a preset amount of time in which to complete a full lap of the track. For each lap of the track that is successfully completed, the players&apos; time is extended. However, if one of the players cannot manage to successfully complete his current lap of the track before the time runs out, his or her game will instantly be over and the race will continue without them. 

The players must complete between three and six full laps of the track in order to win (the number is dependent on how both of the cabinets are set, as with Namco&apos;s own Final Lap). The players will also encounter between four and seven blue CPU-controlled bikes on the track, as the number is dependent on how many people are playing (seven for one player, six for two players, five for three, and four for four).
