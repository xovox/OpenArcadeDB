Full Throttle (c) 1987 Taito.

Full Throttle is a point-to-point racing game in which the player drives a Mazda RX-7 and must reach each stage&apos;s end-of-level checkpoint before the time limit expires to progress to the next stage.

The car is equipped with a limited number of nitro boosts that gives the car a temporary burst of speed when engaged. Forked junctions appear mid-way through each stage, allowing players to choose which route they wish to take.
