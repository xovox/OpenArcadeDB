Fun World Quiz (c) 1990 Fun World.

Insertion of ATS 5 (Austrian Schilling coin) yields 5 credits. For 1 credit a player receives 500 points. At each question a player can bet 100, 500 or all points. If a question is answered correctly, the bet is added to the points. If a player reaches more than 2500 points after 5 questions, he gets bonus questions. The game is over after an incorrect answer.
