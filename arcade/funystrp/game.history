Funny Strip (c) 199? MagicGames.

Funny Strip is an adult "Pac-Man"-like game for one or two players. The two player game features cooperative play with both players working to clear the same maze of pellets. It features Mr. and Ms. Fun as player characters and eight ghosts as enemies. Each ghost turns into a different letter in the phrase 'strip tease'. If the player eats each of the ghosts he will be rewarded with a strip tease between levels.
