Golden Axe - The Revenge of Death Adder (c) 1992 Sega.

Like it&apos;s legendary prequel, 1989&apos;s &quot;Golden Axe&quot;; &apos;Revenge&apos; is sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which the evil &apos;Death Adder&apos; has arisen to take over the lands. The game supports simultaneous four-player gameplay, with each player taking on one of the game&apos;s characters. The four available characters are &apos;Sternblade&apos; (a barbarian warrior), &apos;Dora&apos; (a female centaurian), &apos;Goah&apos; (a giant with a dwarf sitting atop his shoulders) and &apos;Little Trix&apos; (an agile, oriental-style warrior).

As with &apos;Golden Axe&apos;, as well as standard weapon attacks, each character has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will cause the player to charge and smash into opponents. At certain points during the game, players will come across certain creatures and contraptions (such as dragons, giant scorpions and catapults) which, once the original occupier has been removed from the saddle, can be mounted and ridden/utilized to attack the enemy.

At certain points during a level, as well as at the end of each level, dwarfs appears carrying a sack on their back. Players can hit the dwarfs causing them to drop food and magic potions. During the course of the game, players will also come across numerous trapped prisoners. These can be released by either opening their cages (by pulling a rope or similar) or hacking at their foot manacles.

Unlike the linear level layout of its prequel, &apos;Revenge&apos; offers the player a branching route through the game, adding to its variety and longevity.
