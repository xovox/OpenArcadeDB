Galaxian (c) 1980 R. Franco [Recreativos Franco].

Spanish bootleg made by Recreativos Franco, which roughly translates to Recreational Franco, which implies entertainment while playing games. The only main differences between this version and the original are that it's entirely in Spanish, all Namco copyrights have been replace with 'R. Franco', and the ships shoots lasers at a slightly higher speed.
