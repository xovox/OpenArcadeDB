Gals Panic 3 (c) 1995 Kaneko.

Gals Panic 3 is a variant of the classic puzzle game &quot;Qix&quot; where the player works to uncover the highlighted area of the play space to reveal a girl. The player gets to select which girl to uncover before each stage. When a player reveals 80% of a girl the stage ends and the player is shown the entire background image. If the player reveals 100% of the silhouetted image, then he is shown a series of different photos of the current girl before continuing on to the next stage.  Between stages there are mini-games where the player can win the chance to see an image of another girl.
