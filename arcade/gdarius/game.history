G-Darius (c) 1997 Taito Corp.

G-Darius literally added a new dimension to the highly regarded &apos;Darius&apos; series, with the introduction of fully 3D rendered backgrounds and enemies. Namco had already done the same with their Xevious series for &quot;Xevious 3D/G&quot;, released the year earlier, but G-Darius is generally regarded as the most accomplished of the two titles.

G-Darius&apos; game-play was also enhanced, with the &apos;Capture Ball&apos; system; this allowed the player to capture almost any enemy craft and use it against the game&apos;s other enemies. Captured enemies can either be detonated like a &apos;&apos;bomb&apos;&apos;, damaging all enemies nearby; or used to fire a special &apos;Alpha Beam&apos;, which cuts through everything but gold-colored objects and enemy bosses. Each boss is capable of firing its own version of this beam at the player; when both beams meet, they will interrupt each other&apos;s path. Depending on how rapidly the player presses the Fire button, one beam will grow and eventually overpower the others. The Capture ball was actually introduced in &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; but was only used to a minimal extent.
