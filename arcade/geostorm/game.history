Geo Storm (c) 1994 Irem Corp.

Geo Storm is a scrolling run &apos;n&apos; gun platform shoot-em-up for one or two players who must battle their way through numerous enemy-packed stages, each ending with a tough boss battle. 

Each player-character weilds two machine guns simultaneously and can fire in all directions. At certain points during a stage, players may find armoured vehicles that can be entered and driven, offering increased fire-power and protection from enemy weapons, but if a vehicle takes too many hits, players must quickly exit it before it explodes. Enemy troops also have vehicles at their disposal.

Each stage is littered with sexy female hostages waiting to be rescued and medals can be collected for extra bonus points.
