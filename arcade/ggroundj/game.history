Gain Ground (c) 1988 Sega.

A one or two player shoot-em-up featuring single screen levels, in which players must rescue lost troops before making their way to the exit. Players can choose to play as any one of three different characters; each with their own unique weapons, strengths and weaknesses. Time is a factor in this game and all troops that do not enter the exit will be lost. All rescued troops will join the player's ranks as bonus players. The levels take players through fields, castles, forests, forts etc.
