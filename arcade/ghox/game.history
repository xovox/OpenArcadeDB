Under the spell of the evil Magician Jagula, who plots to conquer the world, Lucia, the goddess of light, is confined by the gates of the Netherworld. A dark age is ushered in and evil spirits from mountains and rivers roam throughout the world.

Deeply affected by the horror of the world, King Gitane of the Akura Empire summons two burly and brave men from the Eastern Country and orders them to subdue Jagula.

These 2 heroes journey through the evil spirits&apos; lair which is cut off from the exclusive pious area. Freely manipulating their magic balls, Axis and Bilious plung into action.
