G-Loc - Air Battle (c) 1990 Sega.

A direct sequel to 1987&apos;s &quot;After Burner&quot;, G-loc adopts its predecessor&apos;s action-packed, if somewhat limited, gameplay, although the game&apos;s pace has been noticeably reduced, making survival more a matter of skill than the shoot-and-hope gameplay of &quot;After Burner&quot;.

The bulk of G-Loc&apos;s action is viewed from a first-person, in-cockpit view, but, at certain points of the game, the viewpoint switches to the familiar third-person perspective of &quot;After Burner&quot;, as the player&apos;s jet fighter is tailed by an enemy fighter. The player must roll and turn to shake off the pursuer, once this is achieved the game switches back to first-person perspective.

The object of the game is to shoot a set number of enemy planes as they approach from front and behind; rolling and swerving to avoid incoming enemy fire. Certain stages feature ground-based enemy installations which must also be destroyed. The player&apos;s jet fighter is armed with both a machine gun, and a limited supply of missiles which can be &apos;locked-on&apos; to enemy targets. G-Loc&apos;s levels take the player through a variety of different landscapes, including wide, rolling plains and rock-strewn canyons. Later in the game, the player must attempt to land their fighter onto an aircraft carrier. Failure to do so results in the game ending.
