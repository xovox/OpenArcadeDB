G-Loc - Air Battle (c) 1990 Sega.

A direct sequel to 1987's "After Burner", G-loc adopts its predecessor's action-packed, if somewhat limited, gameplay, although the game's pace has been noticeably reduced, making survival more a matter of skill than the shoot-and-hope gameplay of "After Burner".

The bulk of G-Loc's action is viewed from a first-person, in-cockpit view, but, at certain points of the game, the viewpoint switches to the familiar third-person perspective of "After Burner", as the player's jet fighter is tailed by an enemy fighter. The player must roll and turn to shake off the pursuer, once this is achieved the game switches back to first-person perspective.

The object of the game is to shoot a set number of enemy planes as they approach from front and behind; rolling and swerving to avoid incoming enemy fire. Certain stages feature ground-based enemy installations which must also be destroyed. The player's jet fighter is armed with both a machine gun, and a limited supply of missiles which can be 'locked-on' to enemy targets. G-Loc's levels take the player through a variety of different landscapes, including wide, rolling plains and rock-strewn canyons. Later in the game, the player must attempt to land their fighter onto an aircraft carrier. Failure to do so results in the game ending.
