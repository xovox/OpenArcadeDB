Goal To Go (c) 1983 Stern Electronics.

You must control your quarterback, receivers, and running backs to get first downs and score touchdowns. After you chose one of the on-screen pre-designed plays, you would watch the play develop and have to interact using the joystick, hands, and feet buttons at the proper moments of the play. The game ends if you do not continue to make first downs.
