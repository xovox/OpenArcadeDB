極上パロディウス! ～過去の栄光を求めて～ (c) 1994 Konami.
(Gokujyou Parodius! Kako no Eikou o Motomete)

Gokujyou Parodius is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up and is the first arcade sequel to 1990&apos;s &quot;Parodius Da.&quot; As with previous titles in the series, the game is parody of Konami&apos;s &quot;Gradius&quot; games and picks up where the first game left off. This time, however, Konami also parodies other classics of the genre, including Irem&apos;s legendary &quot;R-Type&quot;, with the infamous mothership that forms R-Type&apos;s entire third level affectionately parodied.

All four of the series&apos; main characters return, along with with a simultaneous two-player mode. Some of the characters do not have &apos;Options&apos; but can instead power-up their weapon and strengthen it until it can inflict massive amounts of destruction. In the two-player game, the second player will have a different set of characters to select. They are clones of the first player characters, except with different names and slightly altered sprites or changed colour palettes.

The game&apos;s title translates as &quot;Fantastic Parodius - Pursue the Glory of the Past&quot;. &quot;Gokujyou Parodius&quot; consists of seven stages, rather than the ten stages of previous games in the series.
