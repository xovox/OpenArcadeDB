Gorkans (c) 1983 Techstar.

In Gorkans, the player must use a four-way joystick to take control of a red flame-like character as he moves along blue lines (moving only forwards) and burns them away to collect flashing or spinning bombs for points before they explode. Gorkans must also watch out for the orange flames (which are palette-swapped versions of him) and also moving along the blue lines and burning them away - because if he ends up touching one of them (or unable to move given that he cannot retrace his steps), he will lose a life. If you are running out of space to go it is also possible to wait in one of the corners for the orange flames to burn themselves out. It is also possible to cut the orange flames off completely from Gorkans  and force them to move along particular lines by clearing out all the lines around the walls and leaving them with no option.
