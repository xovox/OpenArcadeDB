Got-Ya (c) 1981 Game-A-Tron.

You are a &apos;Hand&apos; and so are your enemies. Each hand can be Rock (A fist), Paper (Flat) or Scissors (2 fingers extended). Your job is to clear a maze of dots to move to the next level. If you touch an enemy and your &apos;hand&apos; beats his (e.g. Paper beats Rock), you win, otherwise you lose your current turn.
