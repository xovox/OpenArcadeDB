Ghost Pilots (c) 1991 SNK.

Ghost Pilots is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players set in World War II. An ambitious Nazi general has sent his forces against the Allies andwo freelance ace pilots  called Tom Phillips and Charlie Stingley, nicknamed &apos;Ghost Pilots&apos;, set off in their seaplanes to combat the Axis forces head on.

Before starting a stage, the player must choose one of two bomb types. In one of the two stages after the first, the player also has the option to choose a third unique bomb type (napalm bomb in the land strike stage and air mines in the air strike stage). At the start of the game a player starts with three bombs and can collect up to a maximum of nine bombs. In a two-player game, both players cannot choose the same bomb type.

Enemies consist of tanks, gunboats, jets and a number of other military units. Shooting a row of red planes grants collectible power-ups giving either stronger and more widespread firepower, or additional bombs and extra lives. Certain medium-sized enemies destroyed grant collectible bonus stars for additional score. The player loses a life if the seaplane is hit by enemy projectiles orcollides with enemy craft.

An end-of-level boss fight awaits players at the end of every stage.
