Gradius II - GOFER no Yabou (c) 1988 Konami.

The third game in Konami&apos;s renowned Gradius series; the prequel being &quot;Gradius [Model GX400]&quot; and a spinoff called &quot;Salamander [Model GX587]&quot;. Gradius II strictly adheres to the shoot-em-up template set out by its hugely successful predecessor, the game eschews the sideways/vertical scrolling alternate levels of Salamander and opts instead for Gradius sideways scrolling-only mechanic. This game is rightly considered to be one of the most demanding and difficult shoot-em-ups ever released.
