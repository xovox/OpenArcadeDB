Gradius II - GOFER no Yabou (c) 1988 Konami.

The third game in Konami's renowned Gradius series; the prequel being "Gradius [Model GX400]" and a spinoff called "Salamander [Model GX587]". Gradius II strictly adheres to the shoot-em-up template set out by its hugely successful predecessor, the game eschews the sideways/vertical scrolling alternate levels of Salamander and opts instead for Gradius sideways scrolling-only mechanic. This game is rightly considered to be one of the most demanding and difficult shoot-em-ups ever released.
