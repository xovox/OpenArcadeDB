Golden Tee Fore! Complete (c) 2005 Incredible Technologies.

Golden Tee Fore! Complete is a golf game and part on a long series, whose signature feature is the use of a trackball to determine the power, direction and curve of the player&apos;s golf shot. Play modes include casual 18-hole golf, closest to the pin, and online tournaments. 

As with most golfing games, players have a full selection of clubs from which to choose, although the game will always suggest a club for each shot. Wind strength and direction must be accounted for when choosing the club and making the shot. The game also has dynamic weather in the form of light rain showers, these affect both the way the courses play and visibility. An on-screen indicator shows both the direction and strength of the wind during open play, with another indictor showing the angle and elevation of the putting green once the player has reached it.

Players can hook and slice to curve their shot, as well as utilising the Backspin button to apply backspin to the ball. The game also features a fly-by button that allows players to see a quick preview of the hole they&apos;re about to play. &quot;Golden Tee Fore! Complete&quot; brings together 20 courses from previous &quot;Fore&quot; games, as well as providing new courses, to offer a total of 25 courses. All courses in the &quot;Golden Tee&quot; series are fictional, with no real-world counterparts.
