GTI Club Rally Cote D'azur (c) 1996 Konami.

GTI Club is a circuit-based racing game in which players race around a small town on the Cote d'Azur (in the French Riviera) in one of four classic rally cars, including the Mini Cooper and the Renault 5 Alpine Turbo, or a fifth super-car (at the cost of an extra credit). The four smaller cars all handle and drive the same as each other, whereas the super-car offers greater acceleration.  

Racing takes place in a single location; a picturesque town comprised of steep hills and sharp corners. There are three variations of the track on offer, each offering a different level of difficulty. The 'Easy' track is the standard; the 'Medium' tracks opens up numerous short-cuts and alternate routes, while the 'Hard' track is mirrored.

A handbrake is provided and mastering its use is vital to enable handbrake turns through sharp corners, to reach timed check-points and overtake rival racers.
