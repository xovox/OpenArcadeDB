Gunblade NY - Special Air Assault Force (c) 1995 Sega.

Gunblade NY is an eye-popping, chase-oriented, futuristic-style military gun shooting game that pits you as a sniper of sorts against a horde of crazy Android Terrorists who are causing nothing but trouble in a futuristic large city in the United States of America.

Gunblade NY was pretty popular at the arcades mainly because you can shoot down the enemy missiles and as you destroy the crazy androids, you are &apos;locked&apos; through the android so that you can destroy them one at a time.
