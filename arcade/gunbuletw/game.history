Gun Bullet (c) 1994 Namco.

A challenging light gun game where players can select from a variety of target practice mini games.

Many games require skill and accuracy, such as shooting cardboard cutouts of criminals, a one-shot chance at hitting a leaf, aiming for a specific toy from a shelf, and shooting at objects that move across the screen or rush towards the player.

Your &apos;judgement&apos; is based on your shooting accuracy in some games, and others require you to hit a certain number of targets within the given time.
