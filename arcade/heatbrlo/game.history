Heated Barrel (c) 1992 TAD Corp.

A cartoon style shoot-em'up featuring four wacky western characters: Howdy Pardner, a tough rootin 'tooting' sheriff with a big gun, Chi Chi Gringo, a boomerang toting bearded Mexican, Little Plum, a stereotype Indian brave and Billy Six Guns, a willy quick-on-the-draw roving Clint Eastwood type chap. These four hombres have pledged to rid Dodgem City of outlaws, ne'er-do-wells and, erm, ghosts. Each character has their chosen weapon which may be powered up by collecting the right item until the stage is set for a feast of doom and death.
