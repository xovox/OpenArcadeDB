Hot Chase (c) 1988 Konami.

An action-packed driving game in which the player must drive a stolen enemy &apos;Super-car&apos; - which has a bomb strapped to the underside of its chassis - and get to the country&apos;s border before the timer runs down and the bomb explodes. Enemy troops, road-blocks, planes and helicopters must all be avoided.
