Hyper Pacman (c) 1995 SemiCom.

This is an updated version of Namco&apos;s seminal &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, featuring forced-perspective 3-D graphics that allow the players to jump over the enemy ghosts; in a similar fashion to Namco&apos;s &quot;Pac-Mania&quot;, released in 1987. There are secret items and food to be found on each level that increases the player&apos;s power and score. The power-ups themselves consist of a shield, helmet lasers, speed and jump shoes. Players will face a boss encounter every ten stages and the game ends after the 30th stage.
