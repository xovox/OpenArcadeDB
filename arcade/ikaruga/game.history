(Ikaruga)

A shoot-em-up arcade game which brings a perfect blend of classic arcade shooting and original gameplay. The player&apos;s ship can switch between two different &apos;polarities&apos; : White and Dark. The Dark polarity can absorb dark colored enemy bullets while the White polarity can absorb white-colored enemy bullets. If the player kills 3 enemies of the same color in a row, a combo is built up that adds to the score.
