Image Fight (c) 1988 Irem.

Image Fight is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up with an original premise. The game&apos;s first five stages are supposed to be a &apos;simulation&apos; and serve as training to test the player&apos;s abilities. Player&apos;s will receive a penalty if their hit-ratio is too low.

Once players have proved themselves on the opening stages, they will progress to the game&apos;s last three stages, blasting off into space on a mission to destroy the alien vegetation surrounding the Moon&apos;s main computer. If the player fails in the mission, they must endure the dreaded &apos;Penalty Zone&apos;. Features a high level of challenge, a wide variety of weapons and the ability to change speed.

If the player&apos;s ship is equipped with one or more red/blue extra guns, pushing both Action buttons simultaneously will sling the guns forward in a boomerang-like fashion. This is a powerful and destructive method and can be done an unlimited number of times.
