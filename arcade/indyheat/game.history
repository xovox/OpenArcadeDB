Danny Sullivan&apos;s Indy Heat (c) 1991 Leland.

A 3-player, Indy style racing game with 5 cars that each race around 15 of Danny Sullivan&apos;s favorite tracks. Players can turbo, crash, catch fire, and lose fuel, but they may pit stop for repair. Danny himself always races (yellow car) and players can earn money for more turbo, faster pit crew, acceleration, brakes, and tires.
