Lovely Pop Mahjong JangJang Shimasho 2 (c) 2000 Visco.

Lovely Pop Mahjong JangJang Shimasho 2 is a strip mahjong game featuring matches against the four members of an all female music band called &apos;Tinkerbell&apos;. After defeating an opponent the player is given the chance to play mini-games to gain more points to spend at a shop to buy cheat items.

Compared to the original, Lovely Pop Mahjong JangJang Shimasho 2 has very sparsely animated strip sequences, in place of the lavish animated sequences of the first game the player is given the unique opportunity to control the camera by scrolling up and down the image with occasional cuts to a close-up view of the girls most intimate parts.
