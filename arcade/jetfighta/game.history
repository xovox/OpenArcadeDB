Jet Fighter (c) 1975 Atari.

Jet Fighter puts the players in the middle of a split-second 1-on-1 air battle. The object being to hit your opponent more times than they hit you in the specified time frame. You get a point every time you hit your opponent and vice versa. When hit, your plane spins around and an explosion noise is heard. After a few seconds, the plane recovers then flies off in another random direction ready to fire again.
