Jan Jan Paradise 2 (c) 1997 Electro Design.

A mahjong game with 12 selectable player and opponent characters. At the start of the game the player selects his player character. Then, before every match the player selects his next opponent. Unlike in the original, Jan Jan Paradise, the player is allowed to select his character and opponent out of all 12 characters instead of just out of three characters at a time.  Each character features three different strip images and one animated strip sequence. When the player defeats an opponent, the final strip image of the opponent is replaced with the animated sequence. But unlike in the original, the player is shown the final still strip images of each character he has defeated in a 'gals collection', shown after the player's game is over. When the player loses he is treated to the booby-prize, all of the player character's strip images are shown excluding the animated sequence.
