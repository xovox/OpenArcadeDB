A mahjong game with 12 selectable player and opponent characters. At the start of the game the player gets his choice out of three randomly selected girls to be his player character. Then, before every match the player selects his next opponent out of the three randomly presented characters. Each character features three different strip images and one animated strip sequence. When the player defeats an opponent, the final strip image of the opponent is replaced with the animated sequence. When the player loses he is treated to the booby-prize, all of the player character&apos;s strip images are shown excluding the animated sequence.
