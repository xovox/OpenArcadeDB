Joe &amp; Mac Returns (c) 1994 Data East Corp.

For this sequel to the sideways scrolling 1991 beat-em-up, &quot;Caveman Ninja&quot;, Data East chose to eschew the former&apos;s gameplay and create a single-screen platformer with gameplay hugely similar to Toaplan&apos;s &quot;Snow Bros.&quot;, released in 1990.
