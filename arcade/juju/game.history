JuJu Densetsu (c) 1989 TAD.

The game is a typical platformer in which the player must traverse several levels with a miniboss at the end. Despite his apparent handicap - his slowness as an ape - and the fact that almost any attack can kill him, Toki is able to spit powerful shots that will help him in defeating enemies and obstacles that try to slow him down in his mission. There is a timer for each stage. 

JuJu can make use of items such as power-ups for his spit: lucky rabbit feet which can give Toki bursts of super-human agility and jumping skill, clocks which add extra time to the countdown, fruit which can add to JuJu's bonus points, keys which unlock bonus areas, a special helmet that protects him from upwards attacks, extra lives, and magic coins which when collected in abundance can obtain Juju an extra life.
