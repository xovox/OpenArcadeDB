Karate Blazers (c) 1991 Video System Company, Limited.

A horizontally scrolling fighting game for 1 to 4 players. Each playable character (chosen from Mark, Glen, Akira and Gil) kicks and punches their way through a number of enemy-packed levels. In addition to kicking and punching, each character also has their own unique &apos;special attack&apos;; a move that injures multiple on-screen enemies at the cost of some of the player&apos;s health.

While in no way original (drawing most of its inspiration from Capcom&apos;s &quot;Final Fight&quot;), Karate Blazers is both hugely playable and very fast and frenetic, with the amount of on-screen enemies at times overwhelming. The graphics are also well drawn and nicely animated.
