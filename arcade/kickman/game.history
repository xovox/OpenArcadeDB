Kick Man (c) 1981 Midway.

Move a man on a unicycle and catch falling balloons and Pac-Men on your head. Use the Kick button to make the character&apos;s legs kick out and knock balloons back up for another try. Balloons stack up eight high and then the man will pop them. Stack Pac-Men for bonus points.
