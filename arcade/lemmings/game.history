Lemmings (c) 1991 Data East Corp.

A platform game where the player has to designate certain lemmings for certain tasks & try to figure a way to save as many of them from falling off cliffs and prevent them from dying in other ways. The lemmings can be set for walking (which they do by default), digging, climbing, building, blocking (preventing other lemmings from walking a certain direction), bashing, floating, and mining. There are several levels in 3 or 4 categories of difficulty.
