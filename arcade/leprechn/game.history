Leprechaun (c) 1982 Tong Electronic.

The player controls a sleuth running through a forest, trying to get a Leprechaun&apos;s pot of gold. The pot of gold is randomly placed on the screen. When the pot of gold is touched, the player is taken to the next level. The Leprechaun chases the sleuth through the forest, trying to catch him. If he is caught, the player loses a life and starts over from the beginning of the level. After all lives are lost, the game ends. Should the Leprechaun reach the pot of gold first, it is then relocated to another forest. By touching the trees, the player&apos;s score increases, as does the value of the pot of gold. After each level and after every 30 seconds the Leprechaun&apos;s speed increases.
