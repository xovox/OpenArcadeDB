Laser Grand Prix (c) 1983 Taito.

You must first qualify in the 400 meter preliminary Drag Race. Once qualified, you move on to the 'GP Race', the 'Spark Race', and then the final 'Fantastic Race'. You have 70 seconds to reach the finish line by navigating through the course while avoiding collisions with the walls and other cars on the track.
