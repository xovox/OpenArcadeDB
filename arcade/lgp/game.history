You must first qualify in the 400 meter preliminary Drag Race. Once qualified, you move on to the &apos;GP Race&apos;, the &apos;Spark Race&apos;, and then the final &apos;Fantastic Race&apos;. You have 70 seconds to reach the finish line by navigating through the course while avoiding collisions with the walls and other cars on the track.
