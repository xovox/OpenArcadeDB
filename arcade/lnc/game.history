Lock&apos;n&apos;Chase (c) 1981 Data East.

The game is a maze game. Like &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, you&apos;re trying to eat up dots while four cops (with the names Spiffy, Smarty, Scaredy and Silly) try to stop you. While you don&apos;t have energizers to eat the cops with, you CAN block them off with walls (or better yet, try to trap them in the corners). When you&apos;re finished eating dots, there are two exits for you to escape from the cops.
