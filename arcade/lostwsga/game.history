The Lost World - Jurassic Park (c) 1997 Sega Enterprises, Limited.

If you have a good arm at shooting games you&apos;re fine. But if you don&apos;t have a good arm at shooting games better start practicing, because half of the whole game you&apos;ll be shooting a lot of raptors coming at you 30 miles per hour!!!
