Lot Lot (c) 1985 Irem Corp.

In Lot Lot, you directly control one arrow and indirectly control another which follows after your original arrow with a (roughly) 4-second delay. When you press the button, any balls on the compartment that one arrow points to are immediately swapped with the contents of the compartment that the other arrow points to. The goal of Lot Lot is to get as many tiny balls (which resemble Pachinko balls) out of grid compartments and down into point slots in order to achieve a designated score, and advance to the next round.
