Love and Berry are magical princesses who possess the power of Fashion Magic, which allows them to change clothes instantaneously. Both girls love dressing up and dancing. Though they are friends, they are rivals when it comes to being the most noticeable girl on the dance floor.
This game is targeted toward girls usually between ages six and twelve years. The player would just scan their fashion magic cards to dress up and tap the yellow button to the beat of the tambourine.
