Mad Dog II - The Lost Gold (c) 1992 American Laser Games.

Mad Dog is back, but this time it&apos;s a race to get to the Spanish Treasure. &apos;Shooting Beaver&apos;, &apos;Buckskin Bonnie&apos;, and &apos;The Professor&apos; are three different guides that can help you find your way to the gold. You must fight your way across the countryside coming face to face with Indians, Latinos, and of course Mad Dog&apos;s men.
