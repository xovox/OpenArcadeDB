Metal Black (c) 1991 Taito Corp.

Earth is under attack from an alien race from the &apos;Nemesis&apos; region of space, and human civilisation now stands on the brink of collapse. The invaders have utilised energy molecules - known to earth scientists as &apos;Newalones&apos; - to create powerful beam weapons with which to attack Earth. In response, Earth&apos;s scientists have developed the &apos;Black Fly&apos; project; a powerful space craft that utilises the same Newalone molecule technology of the alien aggressors.

Metal Black is a very playable sideways scrolling shoot-em-up which manages to feel different to other games in the genre, due to the fact that it lacks a a player-definable weapon power-up system. Instead of collecting items that provide extra speed, different weapons etc. players must collect the clusters of &apos;Newalone&apos; molecules that float around each level. These molecule clusters will gradually increase the player ship&apos;s firepower.

As long as the Metal Black ship has sufficient firepower, players can activate the &apos;Beam Weapon&apos;, which generates a powerful energy beam that destroys everything it comes into contact with. The Beam Weapon will only last for a few seconds and its use will reduce the ship&apos;s energy levels. Once the Beam weapon de-activates, Metal Black will have vastly reduced firepower for its forward-firing laser cannon. Players must once again collect the Newalone molecule clusters to build up the ship&apos;s firepower.
