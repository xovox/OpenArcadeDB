Money Idol Exchanger (c) 1997 Face.

Handling money has never been so much fun! This incredibly original puzzle game lets you take control of  hilariously designed characters in a cute Japanese superhero theme and boggle your mind with a puzzle system reminiscent of the Magical Drop games but with a tricky-to-master coin handling twist. Good graphics with lots of funny animations (the intro is indeed a joy to behold!), cool pop music &amp; lots of challenge make this game a true gem to behold!
