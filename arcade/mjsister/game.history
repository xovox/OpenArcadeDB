Mahjong Sisters (c) 1986 Toa Plan.

An early strip mahjong arcade game. You choose from three girls as your opponent, and she removes articles of clothing as you claim mahjonggs. There is also an option to strip her if you manage to get a tenpai hand, by choosing the correct tile from five face down tiles or facing against her in a yakyuken match. If you fail to complete a hand or she wins, however, she will put something back on.
