UltraPin (c) 2006 Global VR.

Only have space for one pinball game in your location? Tired of replacing parts and maintaining the same pinball game over and over? UltraPin is the answer.
UltraPin allows you to have many different Pinball tables on one cabinet. Choose from proven favorites such as &quot;Xenon (Bally)&quot;, &quot;Attack from Mars&quot;, &quot;F-14 Tomcat&quot;, &quot;Medieval Madness&quot;, &quot;Sorcerer&quot; and &quot;Strikes and Spares&quot;. The Best of Pinball with None of the Hassle!

UltraPin features our U-Shock Board which allows players to interact with the cabinet for a totally realistic pinball experience. You can BUMP and NUDGE the cabinet to affect the ball in play - just like real pinball. Ultrapin&apos;s realistic ball movement matches the feel of the original tables.
