Moon Base (c) 1979 Nichibutsu.

A licensed sequel to the legendary "Space Invaders". Moon Base's gameplay is virtually identical to the original game, with the player once again moving a laser base back and forth along the bottom of the screen, shooting endless waves of aliens marching downwards towards the player. Once again flying saucers can be shot for extra points.

Some minor enhancements over the original include the wave number now being indicated on the player's laser bases, and the inclusion of the infamous 'color cellophane overlay', added to give the impression of coloured alien sprites.
