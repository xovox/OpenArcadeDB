A highly addictive puzzle game in which the player must drill down through an endless onslaught of blocks, attempting to get blocks of the same colour to touch and subsequently make them disappear. &apos;Undergrounder&apos; bonuses can be picked up for bonus points and air capsules must be collected to restore the player&apos;s ever-diminishing air supply.
