The Amazing Adventures of Mr. F. Lea (c) 1982 Pacific Novelty.

A four part game where you get Mr. F. Lea where he wants to go (on the back of some lush, tasty dog, of course). You run through lawns and across highways, on the tails of other dogs, and up a hill to get to your destination. Occasionally you even make a run for a dog's head.
