Mr. Kougar (c) 1984 Artic Electronics (ATW).

The game involves Mr. Kougar having to eat all the dots on the screen. The dots are distributed on several moving platforms, which also are the favorites places of the Banalets, the Kougar&apos;s enemies. Touching one of the several eggs on the screen will turn Mr. Kougar invincible and will let a fairy out. The fairy will kill any enemies it touches on it&apos;s way to the top of the screen or will free a Banalet, adding one more enemy for Mr. Kougar to defeat.
