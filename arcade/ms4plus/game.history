Metal Slug 4 Plus (c) 2002 Unknown.

This Plus version is a hack of &quot;Metal Slug 4&quot;. It adds the ability to change, on the fly, the character status (normal=&gt;big=&gt;mummy=&gt;monkey) by pressing the Start button. When using the pistol the dark cloud is always present and after you have picked up a weapon you can press D to cycle through all possible weapons (except the 2-machinegun).
