Ms. Pac-Man Champion Edition (c) 1993 Rayglo Mfg. Co.

Basically this game is &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, with a few minor differences. The major difference is that the ghosts have fewer restrictions on their movement, making them more formidable. Also adding to the challenge are the different mazes and the fact that the fruit no longer stays in one place, but moves in, out and around the maze. Fortunately there is a power pellet in each corner that (usually) turns the ghosts blue for a period of time, allowing you to eat them for points.

Ms. Pac-Man Championship Edition has a timer added which gives you one minute to finish the maze with your Character. As the timer works through the last five seconds Ms. Pac-man slows down considerably.
