Metal Slug X - Super Vehicle-001 (c) 1999 SNK.

Originally released to improve upon some of the problems the previous Metal Slug game (&quot;Metal Slug 2 - Super Vehicle-001/II&quot;) had, most notably its notorious slowdown, this update also implemented several changes to beef up the gameplay, such as new enemies, a different end boss layout and a number of new weapons and secrets. The result is a better game and one of the finest chapters in this series.
