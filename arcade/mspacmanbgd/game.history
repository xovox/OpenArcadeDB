Miss Pukman (c) 1992 Datamat.

Miss Pukman is a pirated version of Ms.Pac-Man that has a few key differences including:
* The ghosts names have been changed to Isabel (Formerly Blinky), Luis (formely Pinky), and Jose (formerly inky). Clyde doesn&apos;t have a name.
* The first ghost has the words Datamat on the top and a half-circle (possibly their logo?)
* Ms.Pac-Man&apos;s name has been changed to VD MISMO.
