Ghouls'n Ghosts (c) 1989 Capcom / Sega.

So much has happened since Arthur rescued Gunievere from the Goblin King and then left home to battle far away from home. Demons have now seized the kingdom and Arthur returns home only to watch the castle's lone survivor, his beloved Gunievere slain before his eyes by Lucifer himself! Now Arthur embarks once again in a one-man battle against the demonic dwellers of the night in order to save Gunievere's soul in this arcade classic. Features excellent gothic-style graphics & sound, improved control & a devilish challenge that will put pros to the test. Love never dies...
