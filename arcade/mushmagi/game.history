Revisit players&apos; much-loved enchanted forest!

Mushroom Magic Classic is a 5-reel, 25-payline game in the Fairy RingTM series. The Fairy symbol appearing on reels 2 and 4 substitutes for all symbols except for the Mushroom scatter/trigger symbol. Three or more Mushroom symbols appearing anywhere on screen trigger 15 Free Games.

Free games can be re-triggered to a maximum number of 300. When the randomly-appearing Butterfly symbol flutters across the screen and lands on any symbol, it returns the bet. When it lands on the Fairy symbol, it triggers the Mystery Feature screen, where the player selects 1 of 5 mushrooms and wins a mystery credit.
