Musoubana (c) 1995 Nichibutsu.

Musoubana is a strip hanafuda game featuring five lovely female opponents. Each girl features three strip sequences: a panty flash scene, a torn uniform scene, and finally a topless scene.

The player must defeat each girl at three rounds of hanafuda.  Points earned at the end of each round are stored and can be used to buy cheat items in following rounds.  Once an opponent is defeated the player gets to play a memory card bonus game for further points to buy cheat items with.

If the player loses a round then the game is over. If he chooses to continue he will start at the same point where he left off at the same strip sequence and with all of his points carrying over.
