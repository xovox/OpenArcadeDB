Naughty Boy (c) 1982 Jaleco.

A maze/shooting game. 

On this fun game the player controls a naughty boy who goes through the forest and must defend himself throwing rocks at monsters to destroy them. The longer you hold down the fire button, the farther your character can throw rocks. The boy must avoid a variety of monsters and obstacles while attempting to make it to the top of each level and proceed on to the next. There are a number of flags at the top of each level on a fortress that must be destroyed in order to proceed to next level.

Occasionally, there is a bonus round where your character fly back and forth at the top of the screen in a hot-air balloon in an attempt to drop rocks down upon a big monster that is running at the bottom of the screen to hit directly over his head. There is a fuel gauge that determines when the bonus round will end.
