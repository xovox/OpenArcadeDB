NBA Jam Tournament Edition (c) 1994 Midway Mfg. Co.

NBA Jam Tournament Edition is a one or two-player basketball-themed sports game featuring two-on-two play. The game features real fully-licensed NBA teams, as well as real digitized NBA players. The game is controlled using an eight-way joystick and three buttons. The function of the first two buttons depends on whether the player is attacking or defending. The three buttons are: Shoot/Block, Pass/Steal and Turbo.

NBA Jam Tournament Edition a direct sequel to NBA Jam, released a year earlier and as with the prequel, features exaggerated over-the-top gameplay, with players are able to jump many times their own height, making slam dunks that defy both human capabilities and the laws of physics. 

With the exception of goaltending and 24-second violations, there are no fouls or free throws and players are free to push and elbow their opponents out of the way. While the action is always two-on-two, each team consists of three players and substitutions are possible.
