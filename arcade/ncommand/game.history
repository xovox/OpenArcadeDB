Ninja Commando (c) 1992 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.

3 ninjas are sent on a mission to stop a madman named Spider from trying to use a time machine to mess with history. The game is almost like a tongue-in-cheek reworking of &quot;Time Soldiers&quot;, which Alpha Denshi made 5 years earlier, with ninjas as the protagonists this time.
