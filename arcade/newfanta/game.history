New Fantasia (c) 1995 Comad.

An adult variation - one of several released by the company - of the 1981 Taito classic, &quot;Qix&quot; (and, latterly, &quot;Gal Panic&quot; from Kaneko), in which players must &apos;colour in&apos; sections of the background in order to reveal a digitized picture of a naked woman in an erotic pose. Like &quot;Qix&quot; and its sequels, Fantasia&apos;s levels are populated with a number of enemies who must be avoided or destroyed. As well as the enemies, players are also fighting against a tight time limit.
