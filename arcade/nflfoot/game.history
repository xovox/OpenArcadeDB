NFL Football (c) 1983 Bally Midway.

This game used live footage from a Raiders / Chargers football game. After the coin toss, you would select your play from the playbook. Once both the offense and defense selected their plays, the videodisc would take over and show scenes from the game to match the plays that were chosen. There was a similar laser disc version of this game that was created for the Halcyon System.
