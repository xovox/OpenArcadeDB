Nightmare in the Dark (c) 2000 Eleven / Gavaking.

A peaceful (yet creepy looking!) gravekeeper embarks on a night-shift battle against zombies &amp; other night dwellers in order to put an end to the grave robbing mystery before the local villagers panic! Features very nice graphics with cool backgrounds, great soundtrack &amp; pretty fun gameplay in the same style as &quot;Snow Bros. - Nick &amp; Tom&quot;, &quot;Tumble Pop&quot; &amp; &quot;Zupapa!&quot;. The deceased must rest in peace, so be sure to remind them of this fact! :)
