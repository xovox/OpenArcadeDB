Oo-edo Fight (c) 1994 Kaneko Company, Limited.

A follow-up to its predecessor, &quot;Fujiyama Buster&quot;, this fighting game takes its inspiration from the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series, featuring digitized graphics, blood, gore and finishing moves, but with the same satirical feudal Japanese setting of the previous game. Though superficially similar to &quot;Mortal Kombat,&quot; the gameplay still resembles the mechanics set forth by &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, just like &quot;Shogun Warriors&quot;.

Nine fighters are selectable in the game, each clearly representing an archetype from Japanese culture, though not as blatant as it was in &quot;Fujiyama Buster&quot;.
