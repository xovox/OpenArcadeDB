Outlaw (c) 1976 Atari.

Outlaw invites the player to physically match his skill against a video gunfighter in one of America's most traditional contests : The fast-draw shootout. Players fast-draw a full scale replica of a Colt.45. A video gunfighter swaggers out from behind buildings in an authentically illustrated western town, turns and waits... and fires! Players have to shoot first and straight to avoid being 'hit'.
