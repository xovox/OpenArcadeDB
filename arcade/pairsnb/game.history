Pairs (c) 1989 Nichibutsu.

Pairs is an adult memory card game featuring five girls.  

The player starts with eight hearts. Every time the player does not find a match he loses a heart. The game is over once a player loses all of his hearts. Upon continuing the player will start the current level over. Some cards on the field are not paired. When an unpaired card is revealed the player may continue to search for a matching card. Once the player matches the Cute Girl cards the stage is completed.

Once a stage is cleared, the player is shown the girl in a specific pose. The player is then given the option to buy an item to use on the girl within that pose.  Each girl has two poses and each pose has two items that may be bought for a total of twenty different erotic scenes.
