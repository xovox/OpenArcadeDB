Puzzle Bobble 2 (c) 1995 Taito.

Puzzle Bobble 2 is an arcade puzzle game offering one or two-player competitive play and is the first sequel to the hugely successful original. 

As with the first game, the aim is to clear each play area of the coloured bubbles clustered in the upper half of the screen. This is achieved by firing bubbles up the screen - with the angle of trajectory dictated by the player - at the clusters of bubbles. The aim is to forms chains of three or more like-coloured bubbles, making them disappear. 

At regular intervals the 'ceiling' of the play area - together with any bubbles stuck to it - will drop one row down the screen, decreasing the size of the play area making life more difficult for players. The game is over when the bubbles reach the very bottom of the play area.
