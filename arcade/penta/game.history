Penta (c) 1982 Unknown [Italy].

Penta the Penguin is the eponymous star of Penta the video game. The basic layout of Penta is akin to that of Namco's legendary 'Pac-Man'; featuring, as it does, a top down, single screen, maze-like arrangement. Penta's enemies, the Sno-Bees, are also similar to Blinky, Inky, Clyde etc. - the ghosts that pursued Pac-man; not least because Sno-bees also come in four different varieties, each represented by a different colour.

One aspect that distinguishes Penta from the Namco classic is that the Maze itself is a wholly interactive environment. Each section of wall is represented as a block of ice, which can be pushed onto the Sno-bees to destroy them. The Sno-bees themselves will destroy the ice blocks as they move around each level, so speed is of the essence. Some of the blocks are 'Diamond blocks' which cannot be destroyed, and can be re-used by Penta.

The outer wall of each level can also be utilised; if the player pushes against the wall when a Sno-bee is next to it, The Sno-bee will be temporarily stunned; allowing Penta to move in for the kill.
