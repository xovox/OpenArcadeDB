Phantasm (c) 1991 Jaleco.

Talk about lousy days! During a walk with your girlfriend you are ambushed by unknown guys who take your girl away and shoot you dead! Now, as a wandering spirit with the ability to possess almost anybody you come across, you are summoned by your girlfriend&apos;s father and given a mission to save her from the mysterious crime syndicate that holds her hostage so that you can rest in peace. Features colourful cartoony graphics, decent music &amp; sound effects, lots of variety (since you can possess any enemy except bosses!) and classic platform action.
