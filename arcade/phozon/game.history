Phozon (c) 1983 Namco.

Phozon is an unusual puzzle/arcade hybrid in which the player controls a black molecule with four red spikes. The idea is for the player to align other floating molecules onto their own molecule to create an increasingly complex pattern; this must match the &quot;blue print&quot; molecule that is situated in the middle of the screen. To make molecules adhere to the player&apos;s molecule, the player simply touches the target molecule with their own. If a molecule attaches in a place that does not fit the pattern shown in the middle of the screen, the player must press the reject button to make if float away. Groups of multi-coloured rotating spheres move around the screen and must be avoided.
