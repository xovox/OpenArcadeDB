Piranha (c) 1981 GL.

A "Pac-Man" hack, the graphics have been drastically altered to present an underwater theme. You control a red piranha, while you are chased around by 4 squid-looking monsters.

Most of the maze in this game is wide open. You are free to move about various open portions of the maze, but so are the monsters.

One central tunnel is present on the sides, as well as another central tunnel on the top and bottom of the screen.
