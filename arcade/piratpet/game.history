Pirate Pete (c) 1982 Taito America Corporation.

Pirate Pete is a reworked version of &quot;Jungle King&quot;. Here&apos;s what makes Pirate Pete different from Jungle King: 
* An opening musical theme is used in certain parts of the game instead of the opening Tarzan yell (unlike in &quot;Jungle Hunt&quot;, it is NOT the same one used at the end of the ocean stage). 
* The player character is a heroic pirate instead of the Tarzan character.
* In the first stage, the player swings on ropes between ship&apos;s masts instead of vines between trees.
* The second stage is set in an ocean infested with sharks, instead of a river infested with alligators and crocodiles. 
* The third stage adds a new enemy - snakes. They appear at the top of the screen and will kill the player if he touches them while jumping. 
* The enemies in the fourth stage are sword-wielding pirates instead of spear-chucking cannibals.
