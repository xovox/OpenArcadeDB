Pong Doubles (c) 1973 Atari.

A follow-up to the original Pong, Pong Doubles is essentially a four-player version of the original. Two players stand on each side of the dividing line, one in front, the other behind. Each pair must work as a team against the other pair. Aside from this, nothing else has changed except the fact that there are now four paddles.
