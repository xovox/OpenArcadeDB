Portraits (c) 1983 Olympia.

Photo-Safari : aim right to capture a number of animals, of four - then five - different kinds. Beware, the animals can destroy your camera. When you get high score, two lights in the cabinet, over the monitor, will light, and a b/w camera will start to capture images. So, the recordman/woman can insert a picture of him/herself between the introductory screens!
