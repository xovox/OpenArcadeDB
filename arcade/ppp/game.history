ParaParaParadise (c) 2000 Konami Corp.

Forget everything you have seen in &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; or &quot;beatmania&quot;!!! ParaParaParadise breaks all boundaries in dancing/rhythm games by putting the player square in the middle of an infrared cage and letting him/her loose on a variety of dancing tunes. Select a song, then go wild trying to break each beam in time to the music. Succeed, and you can continue; fail, and you will have to step down.
