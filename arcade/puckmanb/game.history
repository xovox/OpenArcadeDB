Puckman (c) 198? Unknown

This final bootleg/hack upright model was a complete fake, but there were a lot of them. They seemed to use converted Namco cabinets, painted white, and were decorated with very strange looking sideart that showed Puckmen and ghosts that looked nothing like the ones on any other Puckman/Pac-Man products. (Since when has Puckman had green frogs legs?) The marquee had an odd Puckman logo in yellow and orange, along with a picture of the blue ghost and the strange 'frog legged' Puckman.
