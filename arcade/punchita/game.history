Punch-Out!! (c) 1984 Nintendo.

The player assumes the role of a green-haired boxer, who must fight his way through six increasingly larger-than-life boxers to earn the title of &apos;Champ&apos; in this superb 1-on-1 fighting game.

During matches, the player&apos;s boxer is viewed from behind as a wire-frame (so the player&apos;s opponent can be seen). Players must time their punches, dodges and blocks in order to defeat the opposing boxer.

The player&apos;s opponents are each rendered as humorous cartoon-like caricatures - adding much to the game&apos;s atmosphere - and each boxer fights in a slightly different style, forcing players to adapt to their strategy. The top monitor is used for statistics while the bottom one is used to display the actual fight.
