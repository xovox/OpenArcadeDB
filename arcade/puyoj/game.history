Puyo Puyo (c) 1992 Sega.

An incredibly addictive and original puzzle game in which players must form chains of four or more beans (known as &apos;Puyos&apos;) of the same colour to make to disappear.

Players can hinder their opponent by forming Puyo combinations; a successfully formed chain removes some some of the player&apos;s Puyos and causes &apos;junk&apos; Puyos to fall into the opponent&apos;s play area. As these Junk Puyos are transparent, they cannot be used to form a chain and can only be destroyed when a nearby chain is created.
