Lup Lup Puzzle is essentially the same game as Puzzle Bang Bang. The only major differences are in the service screen options. Puzzle Bang Bang was strictly a Korean game and did not have any nude images. Lup Lup Puzzle comes in English and Japanese and features the option to include nude images. Also, the pictures & No Nude Girls option features a heavier rotation of Asian Bikini models. The nude options feature a decent mix of Asian and European nudes.
