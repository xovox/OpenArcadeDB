Puzzle Club (c) 1990 Namco.

Puzzle Club is a sliding block puzzle video game. The objective of each stage is to make every row in the puzzle show matching animated icons before the timer reaches zero. Once a row is matched that row is shifted to the bottom of the puzzle.  Once all of the rows are matched the stage is completed and the players score is tallied.

There is a 'young' mode and 'adult' mode that is selected at the start of the game. The 'young' mode features icons and characters from the pac-man series.  The 'adult' mode features standard slot game icons. The 'adult' mode also features a bonus stage between regular stages, featuring a sliding puzzle with the animated image of a girl lifting barbells. If the player solves the puzzle within the short time limit he is awarded extra bonus points.
