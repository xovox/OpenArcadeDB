Gouketsuji Ichizoku 2 (c) 1994 Atlus.

The Gougetsuji clan of Kurokos had finally found a new master after Otane Gougetsuji finally defeated the former leader, her older sister Oume. Unfortunately Otane has now disappeared! So a new tournament is called out in order to quickly find a new clan leader. All the fighters from the first tournament have returned as well as some eager (...and strange!) newcomers. Featuring some of the funniest parodies of famous fighting games, a cool soundtrack and tons of new moves making it a way better game than its predecessor, there is no doubt that only the strongest will survive this battle!
