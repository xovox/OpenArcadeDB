Q*bert&apos;s Qubes (c) 1983 Mylstar Electronics.

The object of Q*bert&apos;s Qubes is to jump around diamond formation of 25 cubes and rotate them so that one or more rows of cubes match the shown target cube (a tic-tac-toe) while avoiding the meltniks, the rat and the purple guys. Jumping on anything green is safe, catching the turtle slows down enemies for a short time and catching the freeze ball freezes enemies for a short time.

Each level has four rounds and a bonus round and there are 11 levels...
Level 1 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes only have 2 colors
Level 2 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes only have 3 colors
Level 3 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes have 6 colors from this point on
Level 4 : get 2 tic-tac-toes
Level 5 : get 3 tic-tac-toes
Level 6 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, matched target cubes can be rotated
Level 7 : get 2 tic-tac-toes, matched target cubes can be rotated
Level 8 : get 3 tic-tac-toes, matched target cubes can be rotated
Level 9 : get 4 tic-tac-toes
Level 10 : get 3 tic-tac-toes, matched target cubes can be rotated
Level 11 : get 3 tic-tac-toes

After this levels 9-11 repeat indefinitely.
