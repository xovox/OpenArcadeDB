Quantum (c) 1982 Atari.

Quantum is a reflex-based vector game set in the sub-atomic world of quantum physics, in which the player controls a probe (or &apos;Sparkler&apos;) and must fully encircle atomic particles for points without touching various other particles. Once the particles are surrounded by the probe&apos;s tail they are destroyed.

The game features numerous particle types that must be encircled and destroyed or avoided. First, there are nuclei around which electrons orbit. When a nucleus is encircled (snared) and explodes, the Electrons change into Positrons which, if they are encircled before flying off the screen, are worth extra points.

As play progresses, Pulsars appear. These travel towards the player&apos;s probe, pulsating their arms in and out as they move. The probe is destroyed if it makes contact with any part of a Pulsar. Other deadly particles include triangular Photons, self-deviding Splitters and diamond-shaped Triphons.

In later stages, the nuclei join together, forming bonds. The player&apos;s probe is destroyed if it crosses the bonds when they are red, but can safely cross when they are yellow.
