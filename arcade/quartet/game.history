Quartet (c) 1986 Sega.

A platform shoot-em-up hybrid from Sega for one to four players, selected from either Joe (yellow), Mary (red), Lee (blue) and Edgar (green). The action takes place over a number of sideways scrolling levels, the bulk of which consist of straightforward platform action. On some levels, however, there are jet packs for the players to collect, and the gameplay&apos;s emphasis switched to that of a standard, sideways scrolling shoot-em-up.

The object of the game is to destroy an army of robots that have taken over an Earth colony satellite station. Each level has a boss character that must be destroyed. Upon its death it releases a door key that must be used to exit the level. Weapon and character power-ups can be collected to aid players in their task.

Due to its potential for four-player shoot-em-up gameplay, Quartet&apos;s gameplay feels vaguely similar to (though by no means as accomplished as) Atari&apos;s 1985 classic, &quot;Gauntlet&quot;.
