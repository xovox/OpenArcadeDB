Rafflesia (c) 1986 Sega.

A deep space shooter from Coreland - it has a similar eerie feel to it as in other space shooters such as &quot;Brain&quot; and &quot;4-D Warriors&quot;.

The game scrolls vertically as you maneuver your ship through hordes of enemies while collecting the tears of Rafflesia to power up your weapons. Each sector has a large boss enemy to defeat.

Can you survive to reach the final battle against Rafflesia himself?
