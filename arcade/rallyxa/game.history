Rally-X (c) 1980 Namco, Limited.

In Rally-X, the player drives a car around a maze picking up all of the yellow flags, of which there are ten, before the car&apos;s fuel runs out. The game-play has a similar feel to another Namco legend, &quot;Pac-Man&quot;; although in Rally-X, the mazes are much larger and, with each maze having only ten flags to collect, is more sparsely populated than Namco&apos;s pill-eating legend.

In-game opponents consist of red enemy cars that try to ram into and destroy the player&apos;s car, a problem compounded by the fact that enemy cars are faster than the player&apos;s. A smoke screen can be activated which trails behind the player&apos;s car and causes any pursuing enemies to crash. Each maze also has rock formations which, if crashed into, will result in the loss of a player car. A radar display to the right hand side of the playing area shows the positions of both the flags, and the enemy vehicles.
