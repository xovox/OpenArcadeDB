Rampart (c) 1991 Atari Games.

Rampart is a superb arcade puzzle game in which up to three players must build up a castle using Tetris shaped pieces to form a castle wall and enclose their keep. Each player must then place a limited number of cannons inside their castle wall before the timer expires. Once the cannons have been placed the battle itself begins. Players must target their cannons onto the enemy&apos;s castle (or, in the one-player game, enemy ships and peons) and destroy as much of the enemy army as possible before the time limit expires. 

Once the battle is over, the player(s) must repair their castle(s), again using tetris shapes. The player(s) Keep must be completely encircled with walls, or the game is over. In the single-player campaign, any dark brown ships that manage to reach the coast will unload peons that will attack the player&apos;s castle by land.
