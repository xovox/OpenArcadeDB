Reel 'Em In! (c) 1995 WMS Gaming.

Players will be reeling in the earnings.

The Reel'em In bonus is triggered when a lure appears centered on the payline on the last reel in a potential win combination. In the COLOR DOTAMTION display the bonus starts with 3 fishermen in boats on the pond. The player is prompted to pick a fisherman to cast a line. The picking will be done with existing mechanicals buttons on the 3RM cabinet. Once the player picks a fisherman then that fisherman will cast his line and struggle to pull up a fish. The fishermen make gestures and comments as the fishing struggle plays out. The awards that can potentially be pulled up are 'WILD FISH' which completes the win. 'WILD 2X FISH' which completes and doubles the win, or a 'WILD KING BASS'. When the WILD KING Bass is awarded a random multiplier awards 5 to 12 times.

The LURE bonus is triggered when a 'lure' appears centered on the payline on the last reel in a non-win combination. The player is prompted to pick one or three lures. The awards for the lures are a 2 times bet, 3 times bet, and one has a range of 5 to 10 times bet. The lure is picked the same way the fishermen are in the REI bonus.
