Reel &apos;Em In! (c) 1995 WMS Gaming.

Players will be reeling in the earnings.

The Reel&apos;em In bonus is triggered when a lure appears centered on the payline on the last reel in a potential win combination. In the COLOR DOTAMTION display the bonus starts with 3 fishermen in boats on the pond. The player is prompted to pick a fisherman to cast a line. The picking will be done with existing mechanicals buttons on the 3RM cabinet. Once the player picks a fisherman then that fisherman will cast his line and struggle to pull up a fish. The fishermen make gestures and comments as the fishing struggle plays out. The awards that can potentially be pulled up are &apos;WILD FISH&apos; which completes the win. &apos;WILD 2X FISH&apos; which completes and doubles the win, or a &apos;WILD KING BASS&apos;. When the WILD KING Bass is awarded a random multiplier awards 5 to 12 times.

The LURE bonus is triggered when a &apos;lure&apos; appears centered on the payline on the last reel in a non-win combination. The player is prompted to pick one or three lures. The awards for the lures are a 2 times bet, 3 times bet, and one has a range of 5 to 10 times bet. The lure is picked the same way the fishermen are in the REI bonus.
