Renegade (c) 1986 Taito America Corp.

Western version of &quot;Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun [Model TA-0018]&quot;. The game&apos;s graphics were redrawn for the game&apos;s localization as Renegade to the game&apos;s characters and settings a western feel. The plot was also changed from beating up numerous gangs who are bullying the main character&apos;s best friend to rescuing the main character&apos;s girlfriend. Kunio, the main character in the Japanese, would return in numerous games including &quot;Nekketsu Koukou Dodgeball-bu&quot;, the Japanese version of &quot;Super Dodge Ball&quot;, some which underwent a similar localization process when they were released in the west (such as the NES game River City Ransom).
