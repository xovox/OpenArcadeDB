Return of the Invaders (c) 1985 Taito Corp.

A full colour update of the legendary original; featuring challenge stages and circling aliens. Return of the Invaders, while playable enough in its own right, would be vastly improved upon by its sequel, "Super Space Invaders '91", released five years' later.
