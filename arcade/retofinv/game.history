Return of the Invaders (c) 1985 Taito Corp.

A full colour update of the legendary original; featuring challenge stages and circling aliens. Return of the Invaders, while playable enough in its own right, would be vastly improved upon by its sequel, &quot;Super Space Invaders &apos;91&quot;, released five years&apos; later.
