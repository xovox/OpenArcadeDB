Rezon (c) 1991 Allumer, Limited.

A reasonably playable, if wholly unremarkable sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up that unashamedly rips off Irem&apos;s legendary &quot;R*Type&quot;. Unfortunately, Rezon lacks any of R*Type&apos;s innovations in either level design or the weapons available to the player. One attribute it does share with the Irem classic, however, is that it is extremely difficult.
