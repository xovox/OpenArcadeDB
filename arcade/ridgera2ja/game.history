Ridge Racer 2 (c) 1994 Namco.

Ridge Racer 2 is a racing game in which players take part in races set in and around the fictional Ridge City. Gameplay is heavily focussed on the art of drifting and mastering this allows players to pass through corners while maintaing a high speed. This is crucial in reaching timed check-points and overtaking rival racers.

Players can choose from either manual or automatic gears and start each place in last place. They then have a limited number of laps in which they can overtake opponents and ultimately win the race. The game's environs are geographically diverse and include beaches, forests, grasslands and mountains.

The race will end if the timer expires or the player completes the final lap of the race, whichever occurs first.
