Atomic Robo-Kid (c) 1988 UPL.

In the 21st century, a blast of cosmic radiation bombarded Terra-12, a deep-space outpost of Earth, hideously mutating all transplanted life. A fleet of savage beings followed the radiation wave and invaded the planet, and began the systematic destruction of all remaining sentient life. Years of battling the alien &apos;governors&apos; have gone by, and now only one hope survives to avenge the desperate Terran colonists.

The player controls the Atomic Robo-Kid through six stages of increasing difficulty, facing an alien &quot;governor&quot; boss, which are so large as to be considered levels themselves, followed by a &quot;duel&quot; level against other Robo-Kid sized robots. Many levels branch into others, giving the player the choice over which zone to enter next, increasing replayability.

Robo-Kid can collect four different weapons. Whichever weapon is selected is lost when Robo-kid loses a life. In addition to his default gun, Robo-Kid is able collect powerups for a shield that activates on enemy contact, rapid fire, and speed powerups. The player can also encounter a friendly dinosaur-looking robot that sells weapons and shields to Robo-kid using extra lives as currency.
