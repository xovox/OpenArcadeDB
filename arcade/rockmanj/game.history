Rockman - The Power Battle (c) 1995 Capcom.

Have you ever pictured a Rockman game that allows to skip all the platform elements and just grapple against the bosses? That&apos;s pretty much the main idea in this game! Choose from Rockman, Protoman or Bass and battle against classic bosses in the series. Features great 2-D graphics, solid control, and a nice use of strategy (since the right order of weapons will rid you of specific enemies in no time!).
