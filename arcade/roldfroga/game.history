The Return of Lady Frog (c) 1993 Microhard.

The Return of Lady Frog is an adult puzzle game where the player uses bombs to clear the background and completely reveal the nude photographic image underneath.

Each bomb clears away a nine square grid from the background. Bombs can also be used to clear gray square barriers.  But bombs do no damage to the balloons. if a balloon rolls over the bomb as it explodes then it snuffs out the explosion and reveals nothing. In order to clear the balloons the player can shoot bottle-rockets at them. The balloons explode to drop items for points or break apart into smaller balloons. Balloons labeled with a scull and crossbones cannot be killed and must be avoided. If a player is hit by the balloons then the player is killed. The game is over when the player loses all of his lives.
