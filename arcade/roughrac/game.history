Rough Racer (c) 1990 Sega.

A colourful top-down racing game for one to four players; Rough Racer takes most of its inspiration from Atari&apos;s &quot;Sprint&quot; series, and from &quot;Championship&quot; and &quot;Super Sprint&quot; in particular.

The game features ten different tracks, each with its own graphical theme. After the first race, in addition to the four racing cars a fifth &apos;drone&apos; vehicle is added, whose sole intention is to hinder the four racers. The drone is visibly different from the racers and can be anything from a steam roller to a cement mixer.

To qualify for the next race, players must initially finish within the top three places. In later levels, progression can only be made by finishing in first place. A qualifying place will earn the player money which can be used at a between-stage garage to upgrade the player&apos;s car. Tires and armour can be upgraded, as well as filling the car&apos;s engine with &apos;nitro&apos; fluid. When used in-race, this gives the player&apos;s car a temporary speed boost, although this is at the expense of control.
