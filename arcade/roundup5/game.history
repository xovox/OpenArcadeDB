Round Up 5 - Super Delta Force (c) 1989 Tatsumi Electronics Company, Limited.

A sprite-scaling racing game based heavily on the Taito classic, &quot;Chase H.Q.&quot;, Round Up 5 sees a single player take on the role of a law enforcement officer who must arrest five criminals. 

As well as the Miami Vice-esque gameplay theme, Round Up also borrows the fork-in-the-road level design of the Taito classic; an idea that was itself taken from Sega&apos;s 1986 legend, &quot;Out Run&quot;.
