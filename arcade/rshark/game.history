R-Shark (c) 1995 Dooyong.

A space-themed vertically scrolling shoot&apos;em up that is very similar to, and no better than, the myriad of similar shoot&apos; em ups that were around at the time. Despite its name, R-Shark has nothing whatsoever in common with Irem&apos;s superb &quot;R-type&quot; series.
