The Rumble Fish (c) 2004 Sammy.

This 2-D fighting game consists of 7 playable characters that all have their own individual special arts, skills and super moves. Rumble Fish is a one on one fighting game which involves one person using their mind to manipulate their opponents mind in such a manner that allows them to gain the advantage over his/her opponent/opponent's character. This form of game system is both fun and challenging and keeps you hooked forever. Each character has their very own artistic and original designs, along with personalities and stories behind them too.
For this fast-paced action one-on-one game you will always have to be on your toes, as you never know at what second your opponent will strike!
