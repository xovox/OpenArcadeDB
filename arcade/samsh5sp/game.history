Samurai Spirits Zero Special (c) 2004 SNK Playmore.

An 'upgrade' of the Samurai Spirits Zero episode with its 24 fighters plus 4 more characters : Amakusa, Gaoh, Zankuro and Mizuki. It's probably the ultimate game released on MVS since SNK Playmore decided to develop its future games on AtomisWave.
