Super Bobble Bobble (c) 1988 Datsu Electronics.

Super Bobble Bobble is a bootleg of "Bubble Bobble".

Super Bobble Bobble has the 'Super Bubble Bobble' code (see "Bubble Bobble" entrie) in dip switch. Also, this bootleg has a new feature in Dip switch where you may control the speed of monsters. 

The monsters 'Mighta', 'Hidegonsu', and 'Drunk' do not throw their projectile weapons (i.e. 'Mighta' does not throw his slow-moving stone balls, 'Hidegonsu' does not throw his fast-moving fireballs, and 'Drunk' does not throw his boomerang bottles). However, the 'Invader' monster, who appears in 'Normal' mode only, does throw his laser projectile.
