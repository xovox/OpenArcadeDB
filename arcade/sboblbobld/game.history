Super Bobble Bobble (c) 1988 Datsu Electronics.

Super Bobble Bobble is a bootleg of &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;.

Super Bobble Bobble has the &apos;Super Bubble Bobble&apos; code (see &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; entrie) in dip switch. Also, this bootleg has a new feature in Dip switch where you may control the speed of monsters. 

The monsters &apos;Mighta&apos;, &apos;Hidegonsu&apos;, and &apos;Drunk&apos; do not throw their projectile weapons (i.e. &apos;Mighta&apos; does not throw his slow-moving stone balls, &apos;Hidegonsu&apos; does not throw his fast-moving fireballs, and &apos;Drunk&apos; does not throw his boomerang bottles). However, the &apos;Invader&apos; monster, who appears in &apos;Normal&apos; mode only, does throw his laser projectile.
