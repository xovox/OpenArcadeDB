The player controls a blue robot character named "Robop" around a 3-D perspective playfield grid, while shooting enemies and gathering items for points and beware the Inchworm it will steal your robotics hands!

Your character, Robop, must navigate his way around a playfied shooting records, snipes and bees to earn points. Gathering hamburgers, nuts, briefcases and atoms will light up the bulbs. The levels advance when all the bulbs have been lit. Robop must avoid the inchworm and pick up his hands if they become detached from his body. The game ends if all Robop hands are pushed off the screen by the inchworm or he is destroyed by the Cherry Bomb.

The left joystick moves Robop, while the right joystick fires. The joystick buttons activate Robop's Super!Charge that both speeds him up and shields him from attack.
