The popular game of Dodge Ball is a rather unique sport in which teams of three players try to knock each other out with the help of special moves and team attacks. In this game you take control of a team and must beat all other teams (you can even recruit the other team&apos;s leader after beating them!) in order to face the  current Dodge Ball champion and take the title. Features cool anime style graphics, catchy music &amp; great sound effects, plenty of moves at your disposal and a solid challenge level. Dodge Ball anyone? :)
