Shark JAWS (c) 1975 Atari.

The game is exceptionally simple. It is just a little man on a screen, the only other graphics are a shark and a fish (oh, and the score). You simply try and catch the fish, without getting eaten by the shark. Then the score counter increments by one, and the fish respawns somewhere else. The graphics are black and white monochrome, and the game is controlled by a single joystick (no buttons).
