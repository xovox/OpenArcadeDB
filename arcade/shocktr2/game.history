Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad (c) 1998 SNK.

More of an update than a full-blown sequel, Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad picks up where the first game - released a year earlier - left off. Once again, one or two players face the might of a terrorist army who are threatening to destroy the world by launching a newly developed weapon-of-mass-destruction if their wishes - to be given absolute control of the newly-founded nation of Billberk - aren&apos;t granted.

Like many Neo Geo sequels, 2nd Squad doesn&apos;t particularly do anything the original didn&apos;t do. There are some improvements, however; graphics have been given a brush up and level design is a little more imaginative than that of the already impressive original.
