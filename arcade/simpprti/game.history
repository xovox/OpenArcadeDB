The Simpsons Pinball Party (c) 2003 Stern Pinball.

The adventures of America's most colorful family, The Simpsons, are transformed into a wild affair in Stern Pinball's pinball machine, THE SIMPSONS PINBALL PARTY. The game features many of The Simpsons favorite characters on a two-level play-field, complete with game modes influenced by various classic Simpsons' episodes.

The object of The Simpsons Pinball Party is to  help the citizens of Springfield to party like there's no tomorrow. The game features a talking-moving Homer head  and Bart on a skateboard attached to a captive ball feature, as well as Itchy & Scratchy drop targets and Comic Book Guy. The garage door in the Simpsons' house leads to the second play-field level which features a dot matrix color television, a monorail that transports the  ball across the play-field and a couch that when filled with three pinballs starts multi-ball.
