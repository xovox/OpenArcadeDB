The Simpsons Pinball Party (c) 2003 Stern Pinball.

The adventures of America&apos;s most colorful family, The Simpsons, are transformed into a wild affair in Stern Pinball&apos;s pinball machine, THE SIMPSONS PINBALL PARTY. The game features many of The Simpsons favorite characters on a two-level play-field, complete with game modes influenced by various classic Simpsons&apos; episodes.

The object of The Simpsons Pinball Party is to  help the citizens of Springfield to party like there&apos;s no tomorrow. The game features a talking-moving Homer head  and Bart on a skateboard attached to a captive ball feature, as well as Itchy &amp; Scratchy drop targets and Comic Book Guy. The garage door in the Simpsons&apos; house leads to the second play-field level which features a dot matrix color television, a monorail that transports the  ball across the play-field and a couch that when filled with three pinballs starts multi-ball.
