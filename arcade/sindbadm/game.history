Sindbad Mystery (c) 1983 Sega.

Described as an Intelligent Puzzle Game on the title screen, the player uses a 4-way joystick to take control of the Sindbad, and direct him around various different mazes to collect thirty question marks to reveal the parts of the maze on a treasure map at the top of the screen, while avoiding the various enemies. Once he collects one question mark in a particular part of the maze it will reveal the location of a treasure item for that round. Sindbad will then have to dig up that spot to find the treasure item. Once this is done, he will receive the remaining value of the round&apos;s timer as a bonus.
