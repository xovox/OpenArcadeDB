Snow Brothers 3 - Magical Adventure (c) 2002 Syrmex.

An unofficial sequel running on hacked hardware of the first game in the series, Magical Adventure plays identically to &quot;Snow Bros&quot;; the only difference being that the players&apos; characters are wearing football strips and now encase the game&apos;s enemies in a giant football.
