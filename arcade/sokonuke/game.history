Sokonuke Taisen Game (c) 1995 Sammy Corp.

In this strange party game you must compete in simple yet strange events such as inflating balloons, morphing into dragons, etc., while at the same time protect your partner from 'harmless' pain inducers such as razor-sharp buzzsaws and bombs! Features nice graphics and hectic gameplay!
