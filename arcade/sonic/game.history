Segasonic The Hedgehog (c) 1992 Sega.

A scrolling, isometric racing game for one to three players featuring Sega&apos;s legendary mascot, &apos;Sonic the Hedgehog&apos;. Sonic&apos;s nemesis, &apos;Dr. Robotnik&apos;, is once again intent on World domination and is preparing to launch his latest attack from his new island base, Eggman Island.

When &apos;Sonic&apos;, &apos;Ray&apos;, and &apos;Mighty&apos; drop in to thwart his plans, Robotnik catches them with one of his devious machines. After finding themselves imprisoned in a tower, the trio break free onto the island, and proceed to make their escape and try to defeat Robotnik and his evil plans.

Sega Sonic&apos;s gameplay retains elements of the original console games, such as Sonic&apos;s ability to jump on the heads of enemies to kill them. The golden rings that Sonic collects are also included. Each level is littered with Dr Robotnik&apos;s devious traps; with lava flows, collapsible platforms, locked gates etc. all serving to hamper Sonic&apos;s progress.
