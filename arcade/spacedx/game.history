Space Invaders DX (c) 1994 Taito Corp.

A modern and fitting tribute to Taito&apos;s 1978 seminal shoot-em-up, &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. 

There are now 3 different game modes to choose from. These include a faithful recreation of the legendary original - available in both upright and cocktail versions - and replete with a simulation of the infamous &quot;coloured plastic overlay&quot; that was used to add the impression of full colour graphics to the original game.

The 2 remaining game modes are &apos;Versus&apos;, with simultaneous split-screen 2-player action, and &quot;Parody&quot;, which features characters and graphics from other well-known Taito games, such as &quot;The New Zealand Story&quot;, &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; and &quot;Liquid Kids&quot;. Despite the graphical changes, the Parody version plays identically to the original game, and all modes retain the original, legendary sound effects.
