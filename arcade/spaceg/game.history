Space Guerrilla (c) 1979 Omori Electric.

An old and challenging space shoot&apos;em up.

Your city is under attack! The alien invasion has begun. Army forces have equipped you with the last anti-aircraft tank in the mission to defend the city and avoid his destruction and stop the enemy expansion. You must eliminate all aliens spaceships, but your task will not be easy because as you progress through the level, the enemy attack pattern varies and some spaceships employ a kamikaze attack; the accuracy and his expertise-like soldier will be tested. Good Luck!
