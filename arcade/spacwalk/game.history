Space Walk (c) 1978 Midway.

A sort of &quot;Clowns&quot; game, for one player vs. computer or two players. You both have a spring board which works the same way as Clowns. On the left hand side of the screen, Player 1&apos;s board is higher than Player 2&apos;s. On the right hand side, Player 2&apos;s board is higher.

A spaceman walks out from the side of the screen and jumps. If you do not have any men on your board when the jumper lands, the spaceman becomes a little rocket which launches up to the top of the screen. This rocket is aimable (you have three seconds to position the rocket before the launch) so you can use this to hit the top target for 500 points. The rocket changes back into a spaceman upon reaching the top of the screen.

If you have a man on one side of your board, play continues as per Clowns until the other player captures the moving spaceman (which goes to a Launch sequence) or both players miss the spaceman (which disappears off the bottom of the screen with a noise similar to &quot;Q-Bert&quot;&apos;s Coily jumping off the edge of the pyramid).
