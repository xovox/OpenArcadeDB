Dr Sparkz Lab (c) 1992 Atari Games Corporation.

This game is a combination of Tetris and Pipe Dream, and is very similar to Cachat/Tube It, another prototype. The player has to make connections, or &quot;sparkz&quot; from the red side to the blue side (or vice versa) so that the monster that the scientist is making could be built. The monster is made piece by piece, and the first piece made is the head after connecting 2 sparkz.
