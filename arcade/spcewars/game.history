Space War (c) 1979 Sanritsu.

Another copy of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; with different art and a slightly faster shooting capability. Additional items which make this game unique:
1) Numbers in the bunker to denote rack number.
2) The occasional timed round, with a bonus plus a splash screen for finishing the rack.
3) Invaders change shape as you finish off more racks.
4) When you finish off the first rack, the game asks you for your name. Afterwards, it shows what you input in place of the SCORE1 or SCORE2 above your score.
