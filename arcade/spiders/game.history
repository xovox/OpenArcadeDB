Spiders (c) 1981 Venture Line, Incorporated.

You control a ship that must shoot at a growing spider web and attacking spiders. You must be careful not to let the spider web reach the bottom of the screen or let too many spiders get past you, or your ship will be destroyed. Every few rounds a woman&apos;s face will appear and make affectionate faces at you.
