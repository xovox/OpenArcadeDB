Super Real Mahjong PI (c) 1987 Seta.

Super Real Mahjong Part I is a strait-forward mahjong game. This humble beginning to the long-lived series of Super Real Mahjong games surprisingly lacks any strip sequences.

You play as a man versus a female, smoking opponent as revealed in the sprite animations involved in the game set-up and game-play. If the player loses all of his betting funds then the game is over. There are no continues.
