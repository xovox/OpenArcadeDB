Super Real Mahjong P.V (c) 1994 Seta.

Super Real Mahjong Part V is a strip mahjong game featuring three girls with four strip sequences each. Part V continues the fine tradition of excellent animation for this series.

The gameplay is standard for this series. With every winning hand the opponent removes an article of clothing. With every loss she puts a piece of clothing back on. When the player clears all of a girl&apos;s strip sequences, the next girl is introduced and the game continues. The girls have unlimited betting funds so each strip sequence must be won separately. If the player loses all of his funds then the game is over.
