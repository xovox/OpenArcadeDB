Super Street Fighter II - The Tournament Battle (c) 1993 Capcom.

An exclusive 8-player single-elimination tournament mode of "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers", only available when four SSFII cabinets are connected together and all of them configured to "Tournament" mode. This special mode consists of four simultaneous matches: the initial eliminations, the simifinals, and the finals.

After the first set of matches is over, players are re-arranged accordingly based on their position: winners are sent to either of the two cabinets on the left and losers are sent to either of the two cabinets on the right. In the finals, the players competing for first place are sent to the first (leftmost) cabinet, the third-place players to the second cabinet, etc.
