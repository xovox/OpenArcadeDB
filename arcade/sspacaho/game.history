Space Attack + Head On (c) 1979 Sega.

Head On is a two-dimensional maze racing game. You control your car through the maze to pick up the dots while at the same time avoiding the car, or cars, that are constantly trying to ram you. Successfully get through one maze and many more await you. This is good practice for freeway driving in the big city.

Space Attack is another game inspired by &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. This one is a more straightforward version, although after you finish off a rack a UFO starts working its way down; shoot it and you&apos;ll get a bonus (and maybe a free ship).
