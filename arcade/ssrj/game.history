Super Speed Race Jr. (c) 1985 Taito.

The last game in the &apos;Speed Race&apos; series. 

The player drives a red colored car, guiding it through the streets of a city while avoiding other CPU-controlled cars (one of which is a yellow Volkswagen Buggy), and trying not to go off the road. The player will also have to watch out for zebra and level crossings as pedestrians and diesel-hauled trains pass over them.
