Starblade (c) 1991 Namco.

A 3-D space shoot&apos;em up featuring 2 separate missions; the first is to destroy the planet &apos;Red Eye&apos; while the second is to wipe out the enemy fleet and their leader. The game&apos;s sit-down cabinet featured a seat that vibrated whenever the player was hit, either by incoming fire or by enemy objects such as ships, asteroids etc. The yoke joystick - which had a fire button situated at the top of the stick, underneath where the player&apos;s thumb sits - was very similar in appearance and feel to that used in Atari&apos;s 1983 wireframe classic, &quot;Star Wars (Atari)&quot;.
