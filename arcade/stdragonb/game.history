Saint Dragon (c) 1989 Jaleco.

Saint Dragon is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the galaxy is under threat from a malevolent race of cyborgs. Half animal, half machine, the cyborgs have already conquered most of the galaxy and now have their sights set on the galaxy&apos;s last hope, &apos;The Planet of the Golden Dragon&apos;. A lone mechanoid dragon, unhappy with the actions of his comrades, rebels and sets out to thwart their invasion.

The Dragon is initially armed with a plasma bolts and fiery breath but tokens - resembling bronze-coloured eggs - can be shot to release power-ups to upgrade the dragon&apos;s firepower, offering either pulse torpedoes, a laser, bouncing bombs, ring lasers or a turret. 

Other tokens can upgrade the dragon&apos;s speed or initiate a hyper mode which temporarily gives the dragon maximum firepower and invulnerability. As well as the weapons, the dragon also has an armoured tail which follows the player&apos;s movement, allowing it to be used as a defensive shield.

The game consists of six stages, each culminating in a battle with a large end-of-level guardian.
