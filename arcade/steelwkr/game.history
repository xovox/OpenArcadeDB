Steel Worker (c) 1980 Taito.

The player is cast as the chief engineer of a construction site. They must use a 2-way joystick to select one of ten different types of girders (with a button to confirm his choice) in order to build a bridge so that the Steel Worker may safely walk from one side of the site to the other. If the Steel Worker falls off the bridge, it will cost him a life and he will be resurrected back on that left side of the site. 

The player also has another button to reverse the direction of the Steel Worker - but it can only be used a maximum of nine times. You will receive 50 points for every girder you connect (up to a maximum of fifteen can be used for every stage). There is a a bonus for having the Steel Worker reach that right side of the site. See scoring section for details.
