Striker Xtreme (c) 2000 Stern Pinball.

It&apos;s the International Soccer Championship and your country is in contention for the cup. You&apos;re the team&apos;s most valuable striker and you&apos;ve been given one simple job : SCORE GOALS!

Sixteen teams have qualified for the tournament and you will need to defeat each one of them in order to celebrate victory. France, U.S.A., Spain, Australia, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Holland, England, Brazil, Switzerland, Finland, Italy, Canada, Mexico, and Japan are all in contention, with each team becoming increasingly difficult to beat as you advance through the tournament. So use your three flippers and the corner kickback to score goals as the commentator calls out the play-by-play in one of five languages : English, Italian, French, Spanish or German.

As team striker, there are several shots that you&apos;re being counted on to make: corner kicks, free kicks, throw-in shots, penalty kicks, and shootouts. But the opponent&apos;s goalie, with his belly-mounted target, will be there to stop you with each attempt. So as the competition grows more intense, so do your scoring chances in the Xtreme rounds and in both Stadium and Celebration Multi-Ball modes. Good luck striker...the team is counting on you!
