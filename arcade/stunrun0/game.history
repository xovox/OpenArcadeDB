S.T.U.N. Runner (c) 1989 Atari Games Corp.

Take a seat, grasp the controls, and enter the world of the S.T.U.N. (Spread Tunnel Underground Network) Runner. Players travel ahead in time to the 21st century and experience the thrill of racing in a futuristic form of competitive driving. At the control of state-of-the-art technology, players pilot a billion-dollar vehicle capable of attaining speeds of over 900 miles per hour!

Players control their vehicles with a return-to-center (RTC) flight controller. Control handles adjust shot elevation and include trigger buttons for firing. The start button is also used as a fire button for 'shock waves'.

S.T.U.N. runner is a game of speed. The goal of this game is to travel as fast as possible and complete each race within the allotted time. Numerous enemies prevent the player from achieving this goal. Equipped with powerful lasers, all enemies can be gunned down with the exception of one.

The race through the S.T.U.N. Network is made up of many levels. Each level presents a unique challenge to the player. The player's ultimate goal is to guide the vehicle through the network of levels to reach the 'Ultimate Challenge'. In this never-ending race, players go as far as their driving skills will take them. If the distance they travel qualifies as one of the top five, their name (18 letters) will be displayed along the road for future players to see (only if they reach this distance).

In S.T.U.N. Runner, there is no foot pedal to control speed. Faster speed is achieved by :
* Correctly driving on the fastest portion of the tunnel.
* Staying off side rails (of flat sections).
* Avoiding collisions with enemy vehicles.
* Running over 'boosts' for hyperspeed.
* Avoiding areas under construction.

In turn, the fastest portion of the tunnel is the outer wall. Like a luge or bobsled racer, players use basic laws of physics to attain the fastest speed.  Riding on the inner wall results in a slower speed and hinders a player's ability to reach a finish line. On flat sections, running into side rails creates a visual and audio chattering resulting in a loss of speed. The first race, a training race, called 'Cake Walk', is intended to teach players how to drive correctly.

Red flashing markers in tunnels and flats are called 'boosts'. By running over these, the S.T.U.N. Runner gets a boost of hyperspeed. In addition to reaching the finish line faster, a S.T.U.N. Runner in boost in invincible. The vehicle can pass through all enemy vehicles unharmed and cannot be shot. In this mode the player's vehicle will appear transparent as though it is a skeleton.

The underground network has three different tunnel sections. They include wide tunnels, narrow tunnels, and tunnels under construction. Under construction sections contain portions that are unsurfaced. These areas do not provide full power to the vehicle, and slow down the S.T.U.N. Runner.

Open areas are called 'flats' and are both narrow and wide. Being above the ground, the player is treated to many views of the earth's surface in the 21st century. On flats, players must avoid driving along the side rails. The friction caused will slow down the S.T.U.N. Runner vehicle.

A S.T.U.N. Runner vehicle has six shields for added protection. Colliding with an enemy results in the loss of one shield. At the end of each race, players are awarded bonus points for each shield remaining. A large bonus is awarded if all shields are intact.

In the tunnels and flats are ramps. These ramps will catapult S.T.U.N. Runners above the track for a brief distance. Ramp jumping is often a good method of crossing areas under construction and avoiding collisions with enemies.

When players do not reach the finish line of a race within the allotted time, the game would normally end. However, they can be allowed to advance to the next level on a continuation.

Special Weapon : In selected races, a 'shock wave' is located along the way.  If the player can pick up the shock wave, the weapon becomes available for use. Also, shock waves can be awarded on some levels if the player hits a predetermined number of stars and completes the level. This information is green in the map at the start of each level.

Players activate the shock wave by pressing the start button. This super weapon will destroy all enemies and hazards within view. It is a one-time weapon, but more than one can be stored. The number of shock waves stored is show as blue and white icons on the screen below the level number display.

Bonus Stars : Additional points can be scored along the way by running over 'stars'. In the first race, the training race called 'Cake Walk', the stars are red. Players should run over as many stars as possible. In the remainder of the game, all bonus stars are green.

Challenge Races : These are bonus races awarded to players for reaching various points in the game. Races 5, 10, and 15 are challenge races. Each presents a unique challenge to the player.
* Boost Challenge
* Star Challenge
* Kill Challenge

In each challenge race, players have one goal. Instructions are displayed prior to the start of each race. The time clock still operates, but a game will not end because the time expires. This is considered a free bonus for players. Each challenge level has its own high score table.

Ultimate Challenge : For those players skilful and patient enough, an 'Ultimate Challenge' awaits them at the end. It is an endless race filled with enemies and unexpected surprises. The object is to travel as far as possible within the allotted time. Markers on the road display the names of the five best S.T.U.N. Runners. It is a unique method of identifying the best players of the game. These names are also presented on a separate high score table.
