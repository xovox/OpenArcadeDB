Stunt Cycle (c) 1976 Atari.

Daredevil thrills. A fantastic motorcycle jump and stunt attraction. Realistic handlegrip throttle control accelerates motorcycle. Riders try to jump over an increasing number of buses without crashing--more than 8, it's a wipeout! The roar of acceleration, crashing, the cheer of the crowd--high speed wheelies over more and more buses add to the excitement.
