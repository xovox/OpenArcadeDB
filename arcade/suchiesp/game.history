(Idol Janshi Suchie-Pai Special)

Idol Janshi Suchie-Pai Special is a strip mahjong game featuring seven playable characters. At the start of the game, the player may select from Mai, Yuki, Rumi, Shiho, Sayuri, Erika, or Rei. The player then plays against each girl in a random order.

After winning a hand, the player will play a matching game. The player is given a number of tries to match tiles according to how good of a winning hand they had.  Matching tiles reward the player with bonus items that can be used to cheat during following hands of mahjong. Each pair of tiles removed reveals a still-shot of the current opponent. If the board, is not cleared after all of the player&apos;s attempts are used the player must play another round of mahjong with the current opponent. After all tiles are removed from the matching game, or the opponents betting funds are completely depleted, the player is rewarded with the opponents only strip sequence and moves on to the next opponent.

If the player loses all of their betting funds, then the game is over.
