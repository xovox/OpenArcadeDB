Super Burger Time (c) 1990 Data East.

Super Burger Time is a platform game for one or two players - and sequel to the 1982 original - in which Peter Pepper must once again prepare a set number of burgers per stage, by collecting the separate ingredients needed and dropping them onto plates at the bottom of the screen. 

Stages consist of platforms joined by connecting ladders. At the bottom of each stage are a number of empty plates and the burger ingredients lay across  platforms situated directly above the plates. Peter must make ingredients drop to the platform below, until all ingredients are on the plate and the burger is complete. All burgers must be assembled to complete a stage. Ingredients include the top and bottom of the bun, the meat patty and various garnishes, such as lettuce and tomatoes.

The chef is once again pursued by rogue ingredients, including fried eggs, sausages and green-pea pods. Differences to gameplay from the original include simultaneous two-player action, and the ability to jump. Indeed, peter must now jump on the burger ingredients several times to get them to drop, rather than simply walking over them as in the original game. Many of the game&apos;s stages are now bigger than a single screen (another change from the original) and the display scrolls to accommodate this.

To help peter deal with the angry ingredients, he can utilize numerous kitchen-based items, including pepper (the sole weapon of the original game), a skewer, a frying pan and a water hose. Another new addition to Peter&apos;s world are boss battles, with the Chef having to throw burgers to defeat the bosses.
