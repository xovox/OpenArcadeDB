Another digitized fighter attempting to cash in on the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; craze featuring eight selectable characters and bonus rounds. The producers of this game must have raided the discount Halloween costume boutique. I cannot help but giggle each time I fight Dantel, the incredibly cheap and hilarious white trash ripoff of Shang Tsung.
