Survival (c) 1982 Rock-ola.

One of the the most obscure of all the Rock-Ola videogames, Survival is a multi-directional shooter. The player must use an 8-way joystick and a single button to take control of a blue cell, whose objective is to shoot medicine into viruses through eight mazes made up from rectangular veins and thin cell membranes. Every vein, membrane, and virus that is shot will disappear from the current maze. The color of the first virus you shoot will determine the colour of resurrected ones; and once every virus on the screen is the same colour, they can no longer be shot. 

When the last membrane in the current maze is destroyed, four Aid Stations will appear in the corners for a while - you will have to gain extra shots by reaching one of them before they turn back into veins. Every time you reach an Aid Station and gain extra shots, you will also gain a white cell - once you gain five of these, you will receive an extra life.
