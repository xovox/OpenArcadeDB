SVC Chaos - SNK Vs. Capcom (c) 2003 Playmore Corp.

A one-on-one fighting game - the collaboration between Capcom and SNK - pits seventeen well-known SNK combatants against seventeen of Capcom&apos;s most famous game characters.

&apos;SVC Chaos&apos; primarily utilizes the command system of the &quot;King of Fighters&quot; series, incorporating light/strong kicks, punches, cancels and charging attacks. Unlike its predecessor, however, &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2&quot;, SvC features no air guards and lacks a &apos;groove system&apos;, instead focusing on quicker game play and online competition.

Each character is equipped with a basic three-bar system for executing &apos;Exceeds&apos; (special attacks), with basic filling options attributed to strikes and damage. Additionally, the sprites from the various series received new models and some special effects were changed in the command lists (For example, the player can no longer increase the damage of the &apos;Zujou Sashi&apos; used by Choi Bounge by tapping the buttons).
