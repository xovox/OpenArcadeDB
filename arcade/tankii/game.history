Tank II (c) 1974 Kee Games.

This is a rather basic game. Each player uses a set of two levers to control a simple tank inside a maze. Blast mines and your opponent to win (This is a two player only title, so you will need a friend to play). This is basically the same game as &quot;Tank&quot;, but with different levels.
