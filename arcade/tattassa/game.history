Tattoo Assassins (c) 1995 Data East Pinball.

Nine Tattooed Assassins are ordered by Mullah Abba to defeat Koldan and his minions in this unreleased one-on-one beat-em-up. Tattoo Assassins is little more than a flawed beat-em-up that was originally intended to cash in on the massive success of Midway&apos;s superior &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series.
