Teddy Boy Blues - Yohko Ishino (c) 1985 Sega.

A strange and unique platform game by Sega. Guide Teddy Boy through an ever scrolling maze to defeat ninjas, snails, big mouthed hippos and other bizarre creatures.

You shoot your enemies with a gun that shrinks them - then you must collect your shrunken foes for bonus points. If you don&apos;t collect them quick enough, they will fly down to the bottom of the screen and eat a portion of your time meter.

Occasionally you will get a chance to play a bonus game as Teddy Boy or Yohko Ishino. A target shooting game can be played as Teddy, and as Yohko, you can enjoy a short treasure hunting game.
