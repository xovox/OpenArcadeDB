Teeter Torture (c) 1982 Exidy, Incorporated.

You control a cannon moving left-right on a teeter-totter. Weights with hooks on them fall down at you and if you don&apos;t shoot them they hook on and weigh down one side of your teeter-totter. The weight of your shooter also moves the teeter-totter. A plunger of TNT is attached to either side of the teeter-totter board. If if goes all the way down, kaboom!
