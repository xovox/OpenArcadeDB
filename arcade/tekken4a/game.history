Tekken 4 (c) 2001 Namco.

The 4th episode of the 3-D one-on-one fighting game. The most advanced part in the series with a total of 21 characters. As like other parts of the series, in Tekken4 a few of the old characters like Eddy have been removed... and some new characters like Christie, Craig, Steve etc. have been added. There have been several improvements since the last game in the series like the statues, boxes, phone booths etc. will break on impact due to opponents attack.
