Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection (c) 2005 Namco.

A second update to the Tekken 5 series, many changes were made from the first update that it warranted a new game altogether.

T5: DR features two new characters : Dragonuv, a cold-hearted Russian, whom uses Russian Sambo as his fighting style, and LiLi, a rich schoolgirl from Monaco, whom uses street fighting as her fighting style. Dark Resurrection also sees the return of the characters : Eddy Gordo (you can now select Eddy without having to unlock him as Christie&apos;s hidden outfit) and Armor King.

The game also features somewhat new stages. The stages take place in the original Tekken 5 stage settings, but they take place during a different time of day and with different setpieces. The original stages are also included, but must be unlocked. The forest stage from Tekken 3 has also been remade for this edition.
