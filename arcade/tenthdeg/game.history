Tenth Degree (c) 1998 Atari Games Corporation.

Atari's Tenth Degree was to combine the elements of the Tekken and Street Fighter style fighting games with an emphasis on speed. Videogames.com got a chance to see Tenth Degree in its early stages, and even played a few rounds on the arcade machine. The characters were designed in a 3D anime style, with both male and female fighters available. In the early stages, developers were discussing having a super deform mode and some other surprises as well. The characters would have had a variety of fighting styles.
