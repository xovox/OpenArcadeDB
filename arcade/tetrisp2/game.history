Tetris Plus 2 (c) 1997 Jaleco.

This game features some very nice gameplay. There&apos;s the addition of an ingame character who wanders on the blocks while you play. Secondly there&apos;s a storyline for the game. You get different bonuses on your journey as you keep going on. The game gets quite challenging after you&apos;ve played some levels.
