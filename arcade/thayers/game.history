Thayer&apos;s Quest (c) 1984 RDI Video Systems.

This is a fantasy title, and has unbelievable graphics (hand drawn animations pulled from a laserdisc). You guide young Thayer on a quest through the three kingdoms. You are supposed to defeat Sorsabal The Twisted at the end of the game. This game is far different from most laserdisc games. It is not a &apos;tweak&apos; game, it works more like a &apos;Choose Your Own Adventure Story&apos;. It doesn&apos;t always tell you all your available options, but you do not have to memorize complex, precisely timed movements like you do in &quot;Dragon&apos;s Lair&quot;. Once you know what to do in a given Thayer&apos;s Quest scene then you will be able to do it every time. To make up for this ease of memorization the programmers decided to make the game automatically deduct a life every so often, to keep the player from being able to play forever on a single quarter (which was a big problem with &quot;Dragon&apos;s Lair&quot;).
