The Glob (c) 1983 Epos.

Guide the insatiable Glob through corridors, up and down the elevators and through the side tunnels in his never-ending search for snacks. An assortment of crafty animals relentlessly pursue Toby and fight him for control of the elevators. Stop them or avoid them and munch a dozen different snacks to clear the 24 unique levels. Only difference between this game and Super Glob is the names.
