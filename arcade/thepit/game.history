The Pit (c) 1982 Zilec Electronics.

The player&apos;s avatar (described as &quot;The Astronaut-Explorer&quot; by the game manual) lands in a spaceship and must dig their way into a series of underground tunnels. While there, they must avoid being crushed by rocks, eaten by monsters, impaled by arrows, or melted in a vat of acid. Instead of a traditional timer, is a tank  shooting away a mountain near the player&apos;s spaceship. After collecting the treasure, the only route back to the spaceship is by crossing &quot;The Pit&quot;, which is a room with a sliding retractable floor underneath containing a monster that will devour the player and acid which will also kill.

The player receives 100 points for shooting each enemy, 1000 points for each crystal collected, 2,000 points for collecting large gems, and 1,000 points for crossing &quot;The Pit&quot; safely and reboarding the ship. There is a 10,000 point bonus for collecting all 3 large gems or all 4 small gems, and a 15,000 point bonus for collecting all 7 gems.
