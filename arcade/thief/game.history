Thief (c) 1981 Pacific Novelty.

This title plays a lot like &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, except the maze is more detailed. You drive you car around the maze, picking up the money that is laying around everywhere (just like the dots in &quot;Pac-Man&quot;). Now to avoid being any more like&quot; Pac-Man&quot;, the designer decided to give you four enemies, who each move around the maze with a distinct personality (but they are cars, not ghosts). In a final attempt to make this game different from &quot;Pac-man&quot;, the designer then added dollar signs in each corner of the screen, running over these allows you to chase after your foes, and run over them (not at all like &quot;Pac-Man&quot;). In later levels these dollar signs may be in places other than the corners (finally, something that actually is different than &quot;Pac-Man&quot;). Each level is finished by clearing all the dollars bills from the board (the game will also rate you with a new &apos;Crime Level&apos; every time you complete a screen).
