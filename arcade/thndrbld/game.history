Thunder Blade (c) 1987 Sega.

Taking control of a heavily-armed battle chopper, the player must battle through a variety of both overhead and &apos;into-the-screen&apos; 3-D stages.

Each stage is packed with a mixture of enemy choppers, planes, tanks, boats and static gun emplacements, all intent on bringing Thunder Blade crashing to the ground.

The player&apos;s &apos;copter is armed with 2 different weapons; a rapid-fire machine gun and air-to-ground missiles - both of which have unlimited ammunition.

The first half of every stage begins with a top-down, vertically-scrolling section, before switching to an &apos;After Burner-esque&apos;, into-the-screen section.

Thunder Blade consists of four stages, which are as follows :
* Stage 1 : The game begins in a skyscraper-packed city. Enemies consist of rival choppers, jets, and ground-based tanks and gun emplacements. The level ends over the sea, with the player facing a huge and heavily-armed battleship. 
* Stage 2 : This stage begins with the player navigating a desert canyon, before switching to the into-the-screen view and taking the player through a number of stalactite-packed and densely populated caves. A huge ground-based tank awaits the player at the end of the stage.
* Stage 3 : This begins in a river canyon, before moving on to a rain-forest river network. As well the the usual line-up of enemies, heavily-armed boats are introduced. the end-of-level battle takes place in the skies as the player attempts to destroy a massive jet fighter.
* Stage 4 : The 4th and final stage begins with a repeat of the first stage&apos;s city level, only this time the action takes place at night. The second half of this stage takes the player deep into an industrial complex, eventually leading to an end-of-game showdown with a massive and heavily-armed gun emplacement.
