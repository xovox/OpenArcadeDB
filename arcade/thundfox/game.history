Thunder Fox (c) 1990 Taito Corp.

The world is being overrun by terrorists! Not to worry, since two super soldiers are on the case of wiping out this threat. Features nice graphics and sound, along with solid side-scrolling "Rolling Thunder" style action as well as some side scrolling shooter stages to mix things up.
