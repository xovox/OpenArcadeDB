Time Crisis II (c) 1998 Namco.

A top agent has been kidnapped, and a military satellite has been stolen, leaving 2 mercenaries to track them down and stop the terrorists before they can launch the satellite - and the agent - into space! Contains more of the same duck-and-cover shooting gameplay that made the original Time Crisis so popular.
