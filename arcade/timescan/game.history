Time Scanner (c) 1987 Sega.

An arcade interpretation of pinball featuring the flippers, ramps, targets, bonus multipliers etc. of the classic genre it serves to replicate. Each level has a specific graphical style - in keeping with the &apos;time travelling&apos; theme of the game&apos;s title - with each of the game&apos;s four tables split into two sections. When the player enters either the top or bottom section of a table, the screen will scroll vertically up or down respectively to follow the action.
