Time Traveler (c) 1991 Sega.

Beautiful Kyi-La, Princess of the Galactic Federation, is kidnapped by the evil renegade scientist Vulcor. You control the daring Marshall Gram and travel through the ages of time to rescue the Princess. Adventure through time as you confront space knights, ninja warriors, cavemen, futuristic robots, cowboys and countless other adversaries. Travel from prehistoric caves to 26th century space ships as you battle to save Kyi-La and prevent Vulcor from tearing the fabric of time!

At the beginning of the game you receive one Time Reversal Cube and are given the choice of either learning the moves you need for the game or immediately starting. If Marshall Gram perishes in the midst of the game he can use a Time Reversal Cube to back up to the moment before his death.  Otherwise the player will lose a life and have to start the level over. Additional Time Reversal Cubes can be bought from The Trader for additional credits, but there is a limit of how many Cubes that can be purchased per game.  Once the player loses all of his lives the game is over.
