Touki Denshou - Angel Eyes (c) 1996 Tecmo.

An all-female fighting game featuring 8 selectable angels engaging in one-on-one battle. This game is made by Tecmo, which is not surprising given that they are now more popular because of the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series (specifically because of its female characters) than their older series like &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;.
