Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles スーパー亀忍者  (c) 1989 Konami.
(Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Super Kame Ninja)

A sideways scrolling beat-em-up in which up to four players can choose to play as either &apos;Leonardo&apos; (blue, katana blades), &apos;Raphael&apos; (red, sais), &apos;Michaelangelo&apos; (orange, nunchakas) or &apos;Donatello&apos; (purple, bo staff) as the infamous turtles fight against the might of Shredder&apos;s army to try and rescue &apos;April O&apos;Neil&apos; and &apos;Splinter&apos;, before a final confrontation with their arch-enemies &apos;Krang&apos; and &apos;The Shredder&apos;.

Ninja Turtles featured just two buttons - for &apos;Jump&apos; and &apos;Attack&apos; - making for simple and immediate gameplay. Visually the game made great use of its license and perfectly captured the spirit of both the original comic-book and cartoon series upon which it was based. The game also featured a &apos;buy-in&apos; option, meaning that new players could join in at any time.
