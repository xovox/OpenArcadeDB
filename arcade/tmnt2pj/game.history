Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles スーパー亀忍者  (c) 1989 Konami.
(Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Super Kame Ninja)

A sideways scrolling beat-em-up in which up to four players can choose to play as either 'Leonardo' (blue, katana blades), 'Raphael' (red, sais), 'Michaelangelo' (orange, nunchakas) or 'Donatello' (purple, bo staff) as the infamous turtles fight against the might of Shredder's army to try and rescue 'April O'Neil' and 'Splinter', before a final confrontation with their arch-enemies 'Krang' and 'The Shredder'.

Ninja Turtles featured just two buttons - for 'Jump' and 'Attack' - making for simple and immediate gameplay. Visually the game made great use of its license and perfectly captured the spirit of both the original comic-book and cartoon series upon which it was based. The game also featured a 'buy-in' option, meaning that new players could join in at any time.
