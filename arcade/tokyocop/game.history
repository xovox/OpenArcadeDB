Tokyo Cops - Special Police Reinforcment (c) 2003 Gaelco.

The action takes place in Neo Koban Police station, where we take the role of one of the four Police Agents : Isamu, Kazu, Reika, and Junko and we have to patrol the most conflict-ridden of Tokyo&apos;s districts : Ginza, Hibiya, Shinjuku, and Shibuya. The objective of the game is to clear the streets of dangerous criminals. Furthermore, our promotion depends on the number of criminals that we capture within a time limit, otherwise, we could also be demoted. There are a total of 6 vehicles, each of them with their own characteristics; the cars will be available at different stages of the game. Studying the criminal profile, we will decide which car is more appropriate for pursuing the criminal. The criminals can be from pickpockets to most wanted criminals.

The open circuit will give us multiple possibilities. With situations where we will drive in the wrong side of the road, we will make thrilling line&apos;s changes and will have amazing collisions. Our driving skills and street knowledge will be crucial for the completion of our mission. Inserting our pin number with the keyboard installed in the cabinet, our game will be saved and next time, we will start wherever we left off. Additionally it will provide us with our ranking, the number of criminals we have caught, how many of them have escaped from prison, etcâ€¦ this will be by playing in the same machine or the one that is linked to. Unless, that Tokyocop is connected to Internet, then we can play and get our personal file in any Tokyocop connected to Internet.
