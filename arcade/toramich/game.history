'Ryu Ken Oh' raided villages and kidnapped small children to brainwash them and make them into soldiers. Master of 'Oh Rin' temple ordered his best student 'Lee Wong' to destroy 'Ryu Ken Oh' and save the children. To meet with 'Ryu Ken Oh', 'Lee Wong' must clear 4 stages and destroy big enemy at the end of each stage. 'Lee Wong' was given a magical jacket to jump and fly around, and weapons from the master to destroy 'Ryu Ken Oh'.
