Toy Land Adventure (c) 2001 SemiCom.

'Mr. Monitor' who lives in a peaceful 'TOY LAND' became a devil monitor because of some trouble. In this case, the self-important cat & dog toys talk big to disconnect a electric power of a devil monitor to correct this way with a strong attack to Mr. Monitor's weak followers...

This is a 'Stage Action Game'. There are 6 world and 54 stages. If you made a consecutive explosion with a attack to a inflated enemy, you can clear very easily.
