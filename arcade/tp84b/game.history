Time Pilot &apos;84 - Further Into Unknown World (c) 1984 Konami. 

Time Pilot &apos;84 is an eight-way scrolling shoot &apos;em up and is the sequel to 1982&apos;s &apos;Time Pilot&apos;. As with the prequel, the game&apos;s stages are set over different periods in time. Players must destroy a set number of enemy ships, after which an end-of-level guardian appears. Once this is destroyed the player&apos;s ship warps to the next stage. 

The player&apos;s ship is armed with both a forward-firing gun and an infinite number of homing missiles. Each stage consists of both green and metallic enemies, the green enemies can be destroyed with the standard gun, but both metallic enemies and the end-of-stage guardian can only be killed with homing missiles. As the player&apos;s ship gets close to a metallic enemy, a &quot;lock-on&quot; square will appear over it, fired homing missiles will then follow and hit the enemy. 

Unlike the prequel, which displayed the year in which each level was set, the time periods of &apos;Time Pilot &apos;84&apos; are indicated by new enemies and different backgrounds.
