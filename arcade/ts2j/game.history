Battle Arena Toshinden 2 (c) 1995 Capcom Company, Limited.

Battle Arena Toshinden 2 is a 3-D, weapons-based fighting game featuring a total of 15 different fighters - 11 main fighters, 2 hidden fighters and 2 bosses. Battles take place in a number of 3-D rendered arenas. Unlike most other 3-D fighters of the time - in which only the graphics are 3-D, with the actual fighting taking place on a 2-D plane - Battle Arena Toshinden features wholly 3-D gameplay that allows players to dive out of the path of their opponent&apos;s attacks.
