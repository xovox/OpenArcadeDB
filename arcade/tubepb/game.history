Tube Panic (c) 1984 Nichibutsu (Nihon Bussan Company, Limited).

An early 3-D shoot&apos;em up game.

Pilot your ship through vast zones and large tubular vortex levels full of enemies. The vast zones are similar in gameplay to William&apos;s Blaster, while the tubular levels are similar to Konami&apos;s Gyruss. Upon the completion of the tubular levels, the player must dock with the mothership.

Good luck, fighter pilot!
