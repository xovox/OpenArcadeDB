Turbo Tag (c) 1985 Bally Midway.

An overhead view demolition derby type game where the player has to ram into cars while turbo charged before they park, and avoid the red tag car, or else the turbo charger will be lost, and the player will travel slow. If any car hits the player's car while not turbo charged, the player loses a life. There are other bonus items that can be picked up for points. Collecting all 4 will send the player to the bonus round. There are bombs that the player also has to avoid to prevent losing a life. The round is ended by collecting the T-U-R-B-O letters.
