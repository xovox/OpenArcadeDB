This game is &quot;Ladybug&quot; with more stylish graphics and pictures of naked women between the racks. Like &quot;Mad Donna&quot;, it takes the completion of two racks to see the naked lady picture, unlike Mad Donna completing the first (odd numbered) rack will give you the picture obscured by a pattern.
