Twin Eagle - Revenge Joe&apos;s Brother (c) 1988 Seta Company, Limited.

A vertical shoot-em-up that places the player&apos;s helicopter against multiple attacking targets in the air, sea, and land. Collecting the weapon and speed power-ups throughout the game is vital since the gameplay is quite difficult.

The object of the game, which is not explained further, is to avenge Joe&apos;s brother - which is probably not assumed to be the player, but presumably a friend of the player who lost his brother to the enemy. (It uses bad English grammar on the subtitle of the screen, using &quot;revenge&quot; as a verb, as apposed to &quot;avenge&quot;.  That being said, it&apos;s a pretty tight game otherwise.)  To do so, you must destroy the fortress on the very last level. When you start the game and it scrolls onto the starting screen, the background contains the different levels that you must survive. Ground and sea levels alternate with fighter jet levels.  The starting position of the ground enemies and drones with helicopter blades do not vary from game to game; but fighter jets come on in random positions.
