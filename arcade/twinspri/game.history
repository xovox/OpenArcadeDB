Twinkle Star Sprites (c) 1997 SNK.

Twinkle Star Sprites is a competitive scrolling shooter game originally created by ADK. It was ADK&apos;s last production for the Neo-Geo platform. The gameplay, which can be characterized as a combination of a fixed shooter and a versus puzzle game, uses combinations of shots, as well as timed power-ups to attempt to damage the opponent. These attacks also serve as counters to the opponent&apos;s attack.

An interesting &amp; highly cute hybrid between a Vs style puzzle game &amp; an overhead shooter, players may choose to play the Story Mode in order to see the misadventures of Load Ran &amp; her faithful yet somewhat annoying Rabbicat as they try to find the Magical Twinkle Star &amp; save their world from the evil Mevious &amp; his henchmen. The other option is to play the Free Character Mode in which you are able to pick any character (see codes under Tips and Tricks) to play the game and see their very own comical ending. A second player may challenge you at any time.
