Ultimate Tennis (c) 1993 Art &amp; Magic.

In 1993, the first Art &amp; Magic&apos;s game has been compared with a tornado in the arcade&apos;s world. Based on a clever system of scrolling planes this game looked like a 3D game. The graphic&apos;s quality and the extremely good gameplay pushed &quot;Ultimate Tennis&quot; to the 2nd place in Germany and  to the 14th place in the Japanese charts and was successfully diffused all around the world : 5.000 boards have been sold worldwide and among them more than 500 boards in Japan!
