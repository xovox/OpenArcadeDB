Virtua Fighter 3 (c) 1996 Sega.

Virtua Fighter 3 is the 3rd in the Virtua Fighter series.

The game adds a 4th button, the Dodge button, that lets you dodge your opponent&apos;s attacks. You can move into the screen (by pressing the Dodge button with the joystick in neutral) or out of the screen (by pressing the Dodge button with the joystick held down).

Virtua Fighter 3 also adds undulations in the stages - knowing how to use these to your advantage is key to winning the game (by moving to higher ground, for instance).
