A excellent isometric shooter game.

The player controlling a spaceship through futuristic and claustrophobics space corridors, while fighting on endless battles against swarms of assorted enemies and powerful giant mechanical bosses. You will have at your disposal a main weapon consisting a pulse laser which can be charged up for increased damage and three bombs: one that can make a wave of fire that starts from behind the player&apos;s ship and scrolls &quot;up&quot; the screen, another that makes a powerful circular nova-like blast, and one that shoots several mini-missiles capable of homing in on multiple targets. The game has 6 great stages in total.
