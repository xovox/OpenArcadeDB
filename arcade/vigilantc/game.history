Vigilante (c) 1988 Irem Corp.

A sequel to Irem&apos;s legendary 1984 beat-em-up, &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot;, Vigilante sees the hero&apos;s girlfriend, Madonna, kidnapped by a gang of thugs and driven away in the back of their van. The vigilante must fight through five enemy-packed levels to rescue his girlfriend. As with &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot;, a tough guardian enemy awaits the player at the end of each level. The guardians must be defeated as quickly as possible as their energy bars will replenish in between the player&apos;s attacks.

A weapon, in the form of Nunchakas, can occasionally be found and picked-up; adding to the player&apos;s &apos;kick&apos; and &apos;punch&apos; fighting moves. Some of the game&apos;s many enemies are also armed, with either clubs, chains, knives or guns. The game ends once Madonna is rescued.
