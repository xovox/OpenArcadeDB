In the early 1950&apos;s, a game called Violence Fight was popular in the US crime world. Fighters from all over the USA would compete against each other to become that year&apos;s champion. The winner stood to make a considerable amount of money. 

In downtown LA, a manager called Blinks is training up a new fighter called Bad Blue. He is a strong contender to become the champion and desperately needs the prize money.
