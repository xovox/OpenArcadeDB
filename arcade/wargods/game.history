10 mystical characters and 2 end bosses battle for dominance in a 3-D environment.

Billions of years ago, an alien soldier was transporting his civilization&apos;s life giving ore. The creation of the solar system caused his ship to crash, scattering the ore throughout the newly formed earth. Over time, ten humans came in contact with the ore; they were transformed into super-evolved warriors. These are the &apos;War Gods&apos;! They battle each other for ore to determine the fate of the earth.
