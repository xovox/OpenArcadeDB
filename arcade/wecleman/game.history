WEC Le Mans 24 (c) 1986 Konami.

WEC Le Mans 24 is a sprite-scaling racing game based on the annual &apos;WEC Le Mans 24&apos; race; a grueling event that, as its name suggests, takes place over a 24-hour period.

The width of Le Mans&apos; track never varies and remains at a constant three lanes. The track itself is very challenging and contact with either a rival racer or one of the many track-side objects will often send the player&apos;s vehicle flying dramatically through the air, costing valuable seconds in time.

The car is equipped with both a high and low gear and each lap must be completed within a tight qualifying time or the race ends. The game&apos;s graphics and color palette change to reflect the different times of day over which the race takes place.
