WEC Le Mans 24 (c) 1986 Konami.

WEC Le Mans 24 is a sprite-scaling racing game based on the annual 'WEC Le Mans 24' race; a grueling event that, as its name suggests, takes place over a 24-hour period.

The width of Le Mans' track never varies and remains at a constant three lanes. The track itself is very challenging and contact with either a rival racer or one of the many track-side objects will often send the player's vehicle flying dramatically through the air, costing valuable seconds in time.

The car is equipped with both a high and low gear and each lap must be completed within a tight qualifying time or the race ends. The game's graphics and color palette change to reflect the different times of day over which the race takes place.
