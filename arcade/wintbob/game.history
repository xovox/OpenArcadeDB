The Winter Bobble (c) 1990 Sakowa Project.

Two snowmen battle cute Japanese critters over 50 platform based screens. Turn the enemy critters into snowballs and then boot them around the platforms knocking down everything in their path. Pick up Sushi for extra points. When a screen is cleared of monsters you move on to the next level.
