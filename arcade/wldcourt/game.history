World Court - Pro Tennis (c) 10/1988 Namco.

Tennis sports arcade game released by Namco, and inspired by the 1987 Famicom game Family Tennis.

At the start of the game the players must select either &quot;singles&quot; (Player 1 v Player 2) or &quot;doubles&quot; (Player Team v CPU Team).  They must then select one of twenty different players (ten male, eight female and two robot) before selecting one of three different courts (New York City hard, London lawn, and Paris clay). They must then select whether they want the match to be one or three sets long - and, once they have done so, their two (or four) chosen players will come out, and take their positions on the court. The players must use an eight-way joystick to direct their chosen players around their half of the court and two buttons to hit the ball with their rackets. But just like in a real tennis match, faults, net balls and deuce can occur (but the &quot;Deuce&quot; setting in the options menu can be turned off).
