Wonder Momo (c) 1987 Namco, Limited.

An excellent side-scrolling beat em up game.

We play with a beautiful teen actress named Momo, through various theater levels, she must face of all enemies from the &apos;Warudemon&apos; Phantom Army, with kicks and double kicks and must pick up a tornado item to get the ability to turn into &apos;Wonder Momo&apos; using his super suit that lets throw his &apos;Wonder hoop&apos; and the powerful &apos;Wonder Typhoon&apos;.

When you reach the end of each level, a boss appears and has to be defeated to unlock the next stage.
