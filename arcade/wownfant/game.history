WOW New Fantasia (c) 2002 Comad.

WOW New Fantasia is a game in the adult "Qix"-styled Fantasia series.  It closely resembles Fantasia II but adds an international theme with it's select screen.  You can select girls from the USSR, South America, Europe, Africa, North America, and Asia.

The objective, as in previous games, is to reveal 80% of the silhouetted girl's image within the time limit while avoiding the enemies. But WOW New Fantasia changes things up by removing the monster backgrounds from the game.  The game now punishes sloppy play-style by replacing the hot chick with a fat chick instead.  

There is a bar with a pointer at the top of the screen. If the pointer dips below a certain level (indicated by the change in color) the image will change to that of a fat chick. The pointer slowly creeps towards the fat chick side of the bar over time and moves dramatically towards the fat chick side whenever the player reveals a significant piece of the silhouette. Revealing the un-silhouetted part of the image moves the pointer back towards the hot girl side of the bar. If a round is completed while the fat chick's image is shown then the round must be repeated.
