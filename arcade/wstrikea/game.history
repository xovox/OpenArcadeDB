Witch Strike (c) 1992 Video Klein.

Witch Strike is a jokers wild style video draw poker game with a high/low double-or-nothing bonus game. This is an example of a game that avoids using playing card graphics and gambling terminology to comply with overly specific laws banning video poker games. Cards are replaced with numbered bowling pins, and the on-screen credits, bet and winnings display has no descriptive text.
