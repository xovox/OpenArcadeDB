Yukiwo (c) 1989 Taito.

Somewhere in the 1990s, the world has been throught the holocaust and ended up a rather different place. A new order has sprung up and taken control, but at least one person has decided that this new regime is not to his liking. That person is Yukiwo - the thoughest motorcyclist the world has ever known. To escape from the cluchers of the Earth's new rulers, Yukiwo drives along a blisteringly-paced scroling landscape, fending off attacks from all sides. Ground-based fortresses (both mobile and static), swarms of aircraft and masses of foot soldiers combine to shower a deadly rain on the advancing hero. Yukiwo has a choice of two weapons to hit back with: a short-range cannon for the ground based obstacles and a long-range laser for the aerial attackers. These are activated by the left and right fire buttons and are replenished en-route bu collecting items.
