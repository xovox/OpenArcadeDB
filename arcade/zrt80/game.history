ZRT-80 (c) 1982 Digital Research Computers.

In the early days, most CP/M computers required a video terminal (video monitor / keyboard combination). The 'terminal' attached to the computer via a serial port. The ZRT-80 was a 'budget' terminal - a kit consisting of a single pcb to which one added a parallel ascii keyboard and video monitor.
